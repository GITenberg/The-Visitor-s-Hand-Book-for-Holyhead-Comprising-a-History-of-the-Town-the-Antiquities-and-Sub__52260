4</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Since the opening of the Chester and Holyhead Railway,
thousands of persons have availed themselves of the opportunity,
thus afforded, of visiting this extreme western point of the
Principality.&nbsp; And though the claims of business are weighty
and urgent, still, many will secure a few days in some of the
summer months, for the purpose of repairing, in some measure, the
physical and mental waste of a year&rsquo;s toil.&nbsp; Such
persons, having arrived at the spot where they purpose making a
short stay, are desirous to know how the brief season may be at
once profitably spent.&nbsp; Hence, the numerous inquiries made
by many of the visitors to Holyhead, as to whether there were any
objects worthy of notice in the town and neighbourhood, led the
writer to infer that a small Hand-book, containing the desired
information, was a <i>desideratum</i>.&nbsp; He has, therefore,
made the attempt to supply the deficiency, by communicating all
necessary detail of such objects of interest as the Tourist may
become acquainted with in the space of a short time, at a very
reasonable outlay, and he trusts the following sketches will be
found to afford some hints and observations, not altogether
useless to those who may have the good fortune to visit this
romantic locality.</p>
<p>In the compilation of the present Guide, the writer has
consulted most of the best authors on North Wales, and has
availed himself of that assistance, without which the work would
not have appeared in its present dress.&nbsp; The writer makes no
apology for the religious sentences, occasionally interwoven in
the following pages, for he is fully persuaded that no
excursionist can <i>really</i> enjoy a ramble amid the beauties
of creation, unless he looks &ldquo;through nature up to
nature&rsquo;s God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conclusion, the compiler has only to add, that if the
reader derives any information, pleasure, or profit, from the
perusal of the work, he shall think the time occupied in writing
it by no means uselessly employed.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;In the event of a second edition of this work being
called for, the compiler would feel greatly obliged to any person
who would furnish him with any additional information respecting
any of the objects named in this Hand-book.</p>

5</span>HOLYHEAD.</h2>
<p class="poetry">And thou, Holyhead!&mdash;thy time-honoured
name,<br />
Shall henceforth flutter on the wings of fame.</p>
<p>To trace a mighty river to its source, has ever been
considered a sublime and interesting employment.&nbsp; It is
pleasing to ascend its course from the point where it opens into
the ocean, and becomes an inlet of wealth to an empire, till we
arrive at the spot where it bubbles up a spring just sufficient
to irrigate the meadows of a neighbouring farm, and to observe,
as it receives the confluence of tributary waters, how it
diffuses its benefits to the tribes that dwell upon its
banks.&nbsp; Still more engaging is the task to trace the history
of flourishing cities and thriving towns.&nbsp; The rise and
progress of Holyhead, from an obscure and mean condition to one
of increasing prosperity, is full of interest.&nbsp; Its early
history appears to have had but little attention, and perhaps
deservedly, from the insignificancy of the object.&nbsp; In
giving a succinct account of it, the writer finds himself
somewhat perplexed, in consequence of the very scanty materials
with which he is furnished.&nbsp; The historical guide-stones
placed along the march of time are few and far between.&nbsp;
There are centuries in which the footprints of its history are
scarcely traceable.&nbsp; Roll back the tide of time, and you
will find Holyhead a small fishing village, where</p>
<p class="poetry">A band of fishers chose their humble seat;<br
/>
Contented labour bless&rsquo;d the fair retreat:<br />
Inured to hardship, patient, bold, and rude,<br />
They brav&rsquo;d the billows for precarious food;<br />
Their straggling huts were ranged along the shore,<br />
Their nets and little boats, their only store.</p>
<p><i>When</i> and by <i>whom</i> the Isle of Holyhead was first
peopled is <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>involved in obscurity; to us in this age, this part of
its history is a profound secret; all that is, therefore, said on
that subject must be mere conjecture.&nbsp; Antiquarians and
historians have exercised their ingenuity with respect to the
origin of the name of the town.&nbsp; On this subject there are
various opinions.&nbsp; It was regarded as peculiarly sacred, in
consequence of its being the place of interment of pious people,
and thence called Holy Island.&nbsp; Some suppose the place was
called Holy-head, from the great number of chapels or places of
religious worship that were in it.&nbsp; Others assert that its
most ancient name was <i>Llan y Gwyddel</i>; and they say that
the word <i>Llan</i> probably signifies the Irishman&rsquo;s
beach or shore, and not church, as generally accepted, for the
shore is called in this parish, and no where else in Wales,
<i>Llan y Mor</i>, instead of <i>Glan y Mor</i>; and in support
of this supposition, our histories make frequent mention of the
Irish rovers landing here, and of their incursions into several
parts of the Island of Mona, or Anglesey, and also raising some
rude fortifications to protect their shipping.&nbsp; At the
present time there are places near Holyhead called <i>Porth y
Gwyddyl</i>, (Irishman&rsquo;s port); <i>Pentre Gwyddyl</i>,
(Irishman&rsquo;s village, or hamlet); <i>Cytiau&rsquo;r
Gwyddelod</i>, (Irishman&rsquo;s cottages.)</p>
<p>Again it is conjectured, that Holyhead, like most Welsh towns,
dates its origin from an early Saint; and there are also the
usual stories of miraculous arrivals, especially as relates to
one St. Fraid, (Bride) an Irish Saintess, who, it is said, sailed
from Ireland on a sod of green turf, which, on her landing,
became a firm hillock, and upon which she built her chapel.&nbsp;
And one of the old Bards founds the name of the Island as
springing from this mysterious lady, which he chronicles in the
following couplet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Swift o&rsquo;er the sea the floating island
fled,<br />
While glorious rays illum&rsquo;d her <span class="smcap">Holy
Head</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But its most usual Welsh name is <i>Caer Cybi</i>, (Fort of
Cybi,) so called from St. Cybi.&nbsp; History records the
following account of this singular and extraordinary
personage.&mdash;Holyhead was the residence of a British Saint,
named Corincus, or Cybi, son of Solomon, Duke of Cornwall; who,
it is said, about the middle of the fourth century, after having
lived a very religious life for 20 years, went over to France, to
Hilary, Bishop of Poictiers; and finding favour with the Bishop,
was ordained by him, and officiated as his assistant until the
Bishop&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; He then returned <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>to his native
place; but on account of tribulation in the country, and some
painful occurrences in the circumstances of his family, he left
home again, and arrived at St. David&rsquo;s, and ultimately
crossed over to Ireland; and after residing there four years,
returned and settled in Holyhead.&nbsp; A Prince in Anglesey, out
of compassion to him, in consequence of his low pecuniary
circumstances, gave him a castle, which was in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Cybi founded a small monastery within the
castle walls, and the establishment was called C&ocirc;r Cybi, in
allusion to the monastery, or Caer Cybi, in reference to the
castle walls.&nbsp; Mr. Pennant presumes that the name of the
town has originated from the castle walls, the remains of which
are still to be seen.&nbsp; Mr. Morris says, that Caer Cybi,
lived at the time of the dissolution of the Roman Empire in
Britain, and was contemporary, and on great friendship with
Seiriol, an eminent Saint, of Priestholme, or Ynys Seiriol,
(Seiriol&rsquo;s Island,) near Beaumaris.&nbsp; St. Cybi,
observes Tanner, flourished about <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 380, and founded a small monastery
in Holyhead.&nbsp; In the beginning of the 15th century, the
Irish fleet invaded Anglesey; and after committing some
depredations, returned to Ireland, taking with them the shrine of
St. Cybi, which trophy they deposited among the relics in
Christ&rsquo;s church.</p>
<p>Whether this town took its name from the Irish, who very early
resided here,&mdash;or from its number of chapels,&mdash;or from
the interment of the pious,&mdash;or from the legend of St.
Bride,&mdash;or from the Saint who dwelt within its ancient
fort,&mdash;is surely now of very little consequence.</p>
<p>About <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 389, the Irish, under
the command of Serigi, (the Rover,) landed in Anglesey; and
having defeated the natives, took possession of the Island.&nbsp;
On this invasion, <i>Caswallon-Llaw-Hir</i>, (or the longhanded)
Prince of Wales, came to the relief of Mona; and having routed
the enemy, pursued them to Holyhead, where their fleet lay; here
they fought a second battle, in which Caswallon slew Serigi, the
Irish commander, with his own hand.&nbsp; It is said that in this
action the tribe of Caswallon put the fetters of their horses
upon their own legs, by two and two, to shew their determination
was,</p>
<p class="poetry">Their country, parents, children, save,<br />
Or fill one great and glorious grave!</p>
<p>The few records we have concerning Caswallon-Llaw-Hir,
delineate <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>the great man and the hero.&nbsp; He was the eldest son
of Einion Yrth, sovereign of North Wales.&nbsp; The Triads record
him with Rhiwallon son of Urier, and Belyn, as the chiefs of the
three golden-banded tribes.&nbsp; In consequence of the signal
bravery of the people of Caswallon, in the great battle of
Holyhead, their leader obtained a privilege of wearing the golden
bands, which denoted that no other power had jurisdiction there
except the voice of the national diet, assembled on extraordinary
occasions.&nbsp; After this conquest, a chapel was erected,
within the fortification of Holyhead, over Serigi, called
<i>Eglwys y Bedd</i>, i.e., the church of the grave.&nbsp; This
church was afterwards endowed with distinct revenues from those
of the Collegiate Church, as appears by the College leases; it
was called in the British manuscript, <i>Capel Llan y
Gwyddel</i>, or the Chapel of the Irishman.&nbsp; At length it
fell into ruin, and remained disused for ages; and was ultimately
removed, in order to render the way to the church more
commodious.&nbsp; In digging, the workmen found a stone coffin,
or chest, under an arch in the north side of the chancel, with
human bones of a prodigious size.&nbsp; Serigi was canonized by
his countrymen, and had in this chapel a shrine, which seems to
have been held in exceedingly high repute, for several very
wonderful qualities and cures; but according to an old Irish
chronicle, it was carried off by some Irish rovers, and deposited
in the Cathedral of Christ Church, Dublin; from whence, they were
removed with many others, after the reformation, to &mdash; a
place not far from Dublin, where the relics that could be
preserved from that universal destruction are still kept.</p>
<p>A religious house is said to have been erected here by Prince
<i>Maelgwyn Gwynedd</i>, in the latter part of the 6th
century.&nbsp; Maelgwyn Gwynedd endowed the See of Bangor with
lands and franchises; he also built or repaired Shrewsbury, and
the Castle of Harlech; also the Priory of Penmon; and was the
patron of Taliesin, the Post Laureate, and prince of the
celebrated Bards.&nbsp; A castle, now in ruins, over against the
town of Conway, was originally erected by him; he was contempory
with Prince Arthur:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">In Arthur&rsquo;s days, of ancient date,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Cambria&rsquo;s chiefs elected<br />
Her Maelgwyn to the regal seat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were Harlech&rsquo;s towers erected.</p>
<p>History says he died of the yellow fever, which then desolated
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the country,
in the church of Llanrhos, which gave rise to an
adage,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">The sleep of Maelgwyn
in the church of Llanrhos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holyhead being a landing place for the enemy, was often the
scene of violent encounters, between the Welsh on the one side,
and the Irish, Picts, Danes, and Saxons on the other.</p>
<p>In <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 914, the men of Dublin
destroyed Holyhead and ravaged the Isle of Anglesey.</p>
<p>In <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 958, Abloic, King of
Ireland, burnt Holyhead, and spoiled the country.</p>
<p>The house for canons regular, called the College, appears to
have been founded by <i>Hwfa ap Cynddelw</i>, lord of Llys
Llifon, and one of the fifteen tribes of North Wales, a
contemporary with Owen Gwynedd, who began his reign in
1137.&nbsp; This college was granted by James I. to Francis
Morris, and Francis Phillips.&nbsp; It afterwards became the
property of Rice Gwynne, Esq., who, in the year 1640, transferred
the tithes to Jesus College, Oxford, for the maintenance of two
Scholars, and two Fellows; since that time, the parish has been
served by a Curate, nominated by the College.&nbsp; The Rev.
Charles Williams, B.D., is the present Incumbent.</p>
<p>The head of this institute, formerly one of the three
Spiritual Lords of Anglesey, was usually denominated
<i>Penclas</i>, or <i>Pencolas</i>.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Evans
considers it to have been <i>Pencais</i>, or chief judge in
ecclesiastical matters.&nbsp; But from the inscription on the
exergue of the ancient seal belonging to the Chapter,
&ldquo;<i>Sigillum Rectoris et capitali Ecclesia de Caer
Gybi</i>;&rdquo; it appears that his customary title was that of
<i>Rector</i>.&nbsp; He was styled in a subsequent period
<i>Provost</i>; for Edward III. bestowed the Provostship of
&ldquo;his free Chapel, Caer Cybi, on his Chaplain, Thomas de
London,&rdquo; for which the King, in 1351, dispensed with his
services to himself.&nbsp; The original number of Canons is
uncertain.&nbsp; By an inquisition made in 1553, twelve persons,
styled Prependaries, were found on the pension list, receiving an
annual allowance of twenty shillings each.&nbsp; Prior to the
dissolution, the Provost had an income of thirty-nine marks,
(&pound;26); one Chaplain, a stipend of thirteen marks, (&pound;8
13s. 4d.); and two others, each a moiety of the latter sum.&nbsp;
The estimate, therefore, made in the time of Henry VIII., of its
annual revenue, as amounting to &pound;24, must have been an
under valuation.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>In
1745, the materials of <i>Capel Llan y Gwyddel</i>, or the
Irishman&rsquo;s Chapel, were used for the purpose of building a
Public School, by Edward Wynn, L.L.D., of Bodewryd, in this
county, who gave by bond, dated Nov. 25th, 1748, the sum of
&pound;120 for the endowment of it; the interest thereof to be
paid annually, on the 24th of November, to the Schoolmaster, for
teaching six poor boys of the town to read and write.</p>
<h3>THE CHURCH</h3>
<p>Is a handsome, embattled, cruciform structure, consisting of a
chancel, nave, ailes, and transept, with a square tower,
surmounted by a low flat kind of spire.&nbsp; The present
edifice, exclusive of the chancel, appears to have been rebuilt,
in the time of Edward III., and the latter was repaired in the
beginning of the last century.&nbsp; The inside of the entrance
porch, and the external part of the south end of the transept,
are decorated with rude, but curious carvings.&nbsp; On the
latter are the figures of a dragon, a man leading a bear, and
other grotesque representations.&nbsp; On the pediments and
embattlements are cherubic heads; and one or two figures in
supplicating posture.&nbsp; The exterior carvings, in consequence
of being executed on soft stone, and exposed to the sea, are
almost mouldered away; under the porch, however, where sheltered
from the weather, they are much more perfect.&nbsp; There is the
following inscription, in Gothic characters, on the north side of
the Church,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Sancte Kybi</i>; <i>ora pro
nobis</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;During the last century (says the
Rev. John Price, in his account of Holyhead) the natives showed
the print of Kybi&rsquo;s foot in a rock by the east end of the
chancel, till it was destroyed by the Rev. Mr. Ellis, Fellow of
Jesus College, Oxford, then Curate of this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Long be our Father&rsquo;s temple ours;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Woe to the hand by which it falls;<br />
A thousand spirits watch its towers;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A cloud of angels guard its walls.<br />
And be their shield by us possessed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord, rear around thy blest abode<br />
The buttress of a holy breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rampart of a present God.</p>
<h3>THE CHURCH WALLS</h3>
<p>Are considered a very perfect specimen of Roman
architecture.&nbsp; The form is parallelogram, about 220 feet
long, and about 130 <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>broad; three of its sides consist of massive walls, 6
feet thick, and 17 in height; the fourth is open to the harbour,
having only a low parapet laid on the precipitous cliffs.&nbsp;
At the north-east angle is a circular bastion tower; and along
the walls are two rows of circular holes, four inches in
diameter, having the inside smoothly plastered.&nbsp; The cement,
mixed with coarse pebbles, is extremely hard, and this, in
conjunction with other circumstances, exhibits ancient marks of
Roman masonry.&nbsp; The Church, altogether, will repay the time
spent in its examination.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">THE FILIAL
REQUEST.</p>
<p class="poetry">Beloved Holyhead, farewell!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Every object around thee is dear;<br />
Thy promontory, and meadows, and dell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where I wandered for many a year.</p>
<p class="poetry">But oft has the ocean&rsquo;s blue wave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flowed lately, commixt with my tears;<br />
Since my Mother was laid in her grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where yon hallowed turret appears.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! Sexton remember the spot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lay me beside her cold bed<br />
Whenever this body is brought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sleep in belov&rsquo;d Holyhead.</p>
<p>Holyhead is a place of great antiquity, situated at the
western extremity of Anglesey, upon an island, or more properly a
peninsula, which at high water becomes insulated, but still it
forms part of the county of Anglesey.&nbsp; It is a seaport,
market town, (market on Saturday) and contributory borough.&nbsp;
About three miles from the town the Stanley Embankment crosses
the sands, and an arm of the sea, connecting the Isle of Holyhead
with the main land of Anglesey.&nbsp; This vast embankment is
three quarters of a mile in length, and on an average 28 feet in
height, with a bridge of one arch 19 feet span, under which the
tide, compressed into a narrow compass, ebbs and flows with great
force and velocity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here ocean rushes from her wide domains,<br />
With distant roar salutes the sandy plains;<br />
Now slow, serene, the placid currents creep,<br />
Then backwards roll terrific to the deep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though Holyhead is not of large pretensions, and cannot fairly
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>claim the
picturesque scenery of some parts of the Principality, yet its
history is pregnant with interest.&nbsp; There is an air of the
nautical about the place, and, though near to some of the most
uncultivated parts of Wales, it appears to possess an ideality of
its own, and one differing materially from that of the
surrounding country.&nbsp; It has been but little noticed by some
excursionists, who have favoured the public, through the medium
of the press, with the result of their wanderings; although they
have written largely and excellently on the Principality, they
have scarcely thought it worth their notice to pay a passing
tribute to this ancient place.&nbsp; Indeed, the Island of
Anglesey, which has to be traversed in order to reach it, is flat
and uninteresting.&nbsp; This circumstance, has, doubtless, had
the effect of deterring many persons from visiting this place,
and contemplating the grand marine views around it.</p>
<p>Mr. Walpole, whose splendid work appeared in 1784, makes the
following remark on Holyhead:&mdash;&ldquo;The village consists
of a straggling confused heap of thatched houses built on
rocks.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev. R. Warner, who wrote his interesting
and learned work on North Wales, in 1798, merely observes,
&ldquo;The parish of Holyhead reckons a population of about
2000.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bingley, in his instructive volume, gives
us some half-dozen lines on the place; but Mr. Aiken, and several
others have not so much as named it.&nbsp; From what they had
heard and read, they concluded that the insignificant village
possessed but few events at all worthy of being recorded, and
those few not of the most interesting nature.&nbsp; They,
therefore, refused</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">To strike their harps
amid the cheerless gloom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was Holyhead a few years ago.&nbsp; At that time there
was no harbour for her vessels, but what the rude hand of Nature
had formed&mdash;no lighthouse streaming in the midnight
gloom&mdash;no telegraph to announce to distant parties what
vessels heaved in sight&mdash;no railway train gliding swiftly
and smoothly along the iron-road&mdash;no joyous excursionists
pouring in by thousands, paying their respects to the natives,
beneath the shining of a Summer&rsquo;s sun&mdash;no coachman
with his sounding horn&mdash;no spirit for commercial
enterprise&mdash;no Bible Society&mdash;no Missionary
Society&mdash;no schools to &ldquo;teach the young idea how to
shoot&rdquo;&mdash;no Saving&rsquo;s Bank&mdash;no
Libraries&mdash;no Mechanic&rsquo;s Institute.&nbsp; It could not
boast, like other towns, of advance in trade, or commercial <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>prosperity.&nbsp; It had rather to hang its harp upon
the willows, and wonder why all the mighty advantages that Nature
had lavished on its transcendently lovely Bay, had been so long
comparatively overlooked.</p>
<p>The present century rose on Holyhead like a sun in
smiles.&nbsp; Her growth to importance has taken place within the
last half century; the time of her visitation had dawned, her set
time was come; the tide of her future prosperity sprung
auspiciously; the sympathies of England were turned towards
her&mdash;the wealth of England was expended on her&mdash;and the
experience, science, industry, and enterprise of England were put
forth on her behalf.&nbsp; The erection of South Stack Lighthouse
in 1808, the commencement of the Pier, with its Harbour, Graving
Dock, and Lighthouse in 1810, the Government establishment, and
the completion of the great Parliamentary road, gave a commercial
impulse to the place, and materially contributed to attract and
support a thriving population.</p>
<p>The commencement of the Breakwater, or New Harbour, and the
Chester and Holyhead Railway, sounded the tocsin aloud for the
advancement of Holyhead; and the advantage was taken by the
spirited inhabitants in a manner which did them credit.&nbsp;
Within the last four years, in particular, it has rapidly
increased in extent and improved in appearance: streets and
public edifices, large and well built, seem to have started into
existence as by the enchantment of some mighty magician; almost
everything is new, and everything wonderfully improved, affording
ample accommodation of every kind for the numerous visitors who
may do themselves the honour of reposing within its
precincts.&nbsp; The town is rapidly rising to that
respectability and celebrity to which the salubrity of its air,
its rich and varied prospects, by land and sea, so justly entitle
it; but like most other places in a transition state, it exhibits
a motley mixture of old and new houses.&nbsp; The important
conveyances, vehicles to all parts of the country, the railway,
and steamers, to and from Ireland daily, bestow on it a charm
which it is in vain to look for in any other spot in the
Principality.</p>
<p>There are places of worship, exclusive of the parish Church,
for Independents, Baptists, Calvinistic and Wesleyan
Methodists.&nbsp; There are two Public Schools, conducted
respectively upon the National and British plan; and an Infant
School, under the auspices of the Independents.&nbsp; The British
School was erected in 1848, on land given by the late Lord
Stanley, of Alderley, and <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>the Hon. W. O. Stanley, of
Penrhos.&nbsp; A Mechanics&rsquo; Institute has been
established&mdash;a new Church and Cemetery are in
contemplation&mdash;a Gas Company is formed&mdash;accommodations
for bathing are &ldquo;looming in the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Indeed, although the writer is not a prophet, nor the son of a
prophet, yet he will venture to divine that, a few years hence,
there will be a convenient Market-place&mdash;water will be
brought to every roan&rsquo;s door&mdash;gas, one of the greatest
<i>desiderata</i> in the march of improvement, will illumine our
streets, and other improvements necessary and desirable for the
sanitary condition of the town, will follow in the wake, and
Holyhead will be raised to that position which she is designed to
occupy.</p>
<p>We trust the sun of Holyhead&rsquo;s hope has at length
arisen; may it be the beginning of a bright and prosperous day,
not only in a commercial point of view, but in a moral aspect,
for with increasing shipping, trade, population, &amp;c., will
Christian responsibility increase also; and benevolent efforts to
meet the multiplied demand, we trust, will not be found
wanting.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT CUSTOMS.&mdash;EGG TAKING, FROM THE CLIFFS OF
HOLYHEAD.</h3>
<p>The eggs of many of the birds named in another page were
formerly sought after as delicious food, and considered as a
great treat to the epicurean.&nbsp; The price procured for them
was a sufficient inducement for the poor to follow the
adventurous trade of egg-taking; but in this, as in the pearl
fishery on the coasts of Persia, the gains bear no tolerable
proportion to the danger incurred.&nbsp; Until the dangerous
practice was prohibited, men were employed in collecting them in
the following manner.&nbsp; The adventurers having furnished
themselves with every necessary implement for the business, while
the sun afforded assistance by his beams, entered on the terrific
undertaking.&nbsp; Two&mdash;for this was a trade in which
co-partnership was absolutely necessary&mdash;took a station; and
he whose turn it happened to be, or whose superior agility
rendered it eligible, prepared for the rupestrian
expedition.&nbsp; A strong stake was driven into the ground, at
some <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>distance from the edge of the cliff, to which a rope, of
sufficient length to reach the lowest haunts of the birds, was
affixed.&nbsp; Fastening the other end round his middle, taking
the coil on his arm, and laying hold with both his hands, he
threw himself over the brow of the cliff, placing his feet
against its sides, and carefully shifting his hands, he gradually
descended till he came to the abode of the birds; then putting
his hand into the hole, while suspending himself with the other,
he took possession of its contents, carefully placing the eggs in
a basket slung at his back for the purpose.&nbsp; Having
despoiled all the nests within his extent of rope, he ascended by
the same means to the edge of the cliff, where his partner, whose
duty hitherto was to guard the stake, crawling on hands and
knees, afforded him assistance in doubling the cliff, which
otherwise he would be unable to do.&nbsp; Dangerous
occupation!&nbsp; A slip of the foot, or the hand, would in an
instant be fatal to both.&nbsp; Instances have occurred where the
weight of the one overcoming the strength of the other, both have
been precipitated down the craggy steep, and their mangled
carcases buried in the ocean.</p>
<p>To a stranger and bystander, this occupation appeared more
dangerous than it really was; in persons habituated to bodily
difficulty, the nervous system became gradually braced, and the
solids attained that state of rigidity which banished
irritability; while the mind, accustomed to scenes of danger,
lost that timidity which frequently led to the dreadful
disaster.&nbsp; To the person whose heart palpitates at the near
approach to such heights, it must appear a presumptuous venture,
and daily instances of its fatality might be expected; but facts
demonstrate the contrary, and serve to prove how much we are the
creatures of habit, and to what an extent difficulty and danger
may be made subordinate to art and perseverance.&nbsp; A sight of
this perilous employment would remind the beholder of that fine
description&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;
How fearful<br />
And dizzy &rsquo;tis to cast one&rsquo;s eyes so low!<br />
The crows and choughs, that wing the midnight air,<br />
Shew scarce so gross as beetles.&nbsp; Half-way down<br />
Hangs one who gathers samphire;&mdash;dreadful trade.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>SHALL I GET MARRIED THIS MONTH?</h3>
<p>During the last century a singular custom was observed at
<i>Capel Lochwyd</i>, on the celebration of the annual wakes at
Holyhead.&nbsp; <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>This joyous festival then continued a fortnight and a
day,&mdash;commencing the Sunday before the 25th of July, and
ending the second Sunday after.&nbsp; On each of the three
Sundays of the wakes, all the inhabitants of the town and
neighbourhood, old and young, repaired to the chapel, which is
situated on a very high part of the mountain, on the west side,
close to a cleft, or ravine, that leads down, or rather led down,
to the sea shore, (as the pass is now partly obstructed by loose
stones); the old to be spectators, and the young, of both sexes
that were or thought that they were marriageable, to be
actors.&nbsp; On the shore, just above high water-mark, there is
a well of most delicious water, called Ffynon (well) of
Lochwyd,&mdash;having fine gravel at the bottom; and the custom
was, for the lasses and lads to take a mouthful of the water, and
fill both their hands with the gravel from the bottom of the
well, and then endeavour to ascend the ravine (which must at all
times have been very difficult,) to the chapel.&nbsp; Whoever
succeeded, without spilling a drop of the water or dropping a
single pebble, in arriving at the chapel, and casting the water
and gravel on the altar, was esteemed certain of being married
before the moon had attained its greatest age.&nbsp; The distance
between the well and the chapel is about a quarter of a mile; and
those who had been unfortunate in either spilling the water or
dropping the gravel, were obliged to return; and, to defeat the
endeavour of others to ascend, they used all their wit, resorting
to grimace and buffoonery to excite laughter in those they met;
by which means, very few ever reached the desired goal with the
freight they started with from the well.&nbsp; And even, some of
those who were successful, I opine, would have another difficulty
to grapple with, perhaps greater than that of carrying water and
pebbles from the well to the chapel, viz., that of obtaining a
suitable &ldquo;help-mate&rdquo; in so short a time.&nbsp; As
this ceremony took place only on the Sundays of the wakes, it was
called &ldquo;Suliau y Creiriau,&rdquo; (Sabbaths of the
Relics.)&nbsp; The altar disappeared many years ago, and there is
scarcely a vestige of the chapel left.</p>
<h3>DANCING MATCH.</h3>
<p>During the week-days of the wakes at Holyhead, as many
musicians were collected together as could be found in and around
the town; and one of them played till he was tired, when he was
relieved by a fresh one; so that there was music without
cessation.&nbsp; To this music twenty young women danced till
they <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>were
tired; and who ever held out the longest gained the prize of a
complete suit of apparel; if it was not decided in one day, the
whole twenty commenced again on the following day, and so on to
the end of the wakes.&nbsp; This prize, like the &ldquo;Suliau y
Creiriau,&rdquo; was left sometimes undecided, as the girls would
dance till they fainted, rather than acknowledge a defeat.&nbsp;
There was an old woman living in this parish in 1826, and who was
then nearly a hundred years of age, who, in her youth, assisted
in the performance of both the above customs.&nbsp; These
barbarous usages were suppressed by a pious Curate of Holyhead,
of the name of Ellis, about the year 1748.</p>
<h3>HOLYHEAD PIER&mdash;OLD HARBOUR.</h3>
<p>The first stone of this great national work was laid in the
month of August, 1810.&nbsp; The Pier extends from the small
island called <i>Ynys Halen</i>, or <i>Salt Island</i>, in an
east-south-east direction into the sea; and is about 1000 feet in
length.&nbsp; On the south side it is faced with a perpendicular
wall of cut stone; near the east end a spur projects 60 feet at
right angles with the wall, so as to afford shelter from the east
winds.&nbsp; The back of the Pier, or part towards the sea, is on
an inclined plane from the top of the parapet, and is built with
large rough stones placed edge-ways, as close together as
possible, and wedged with smaller ones, so that the sea has no
power over it.&nbsp; A morning or evening walk on the parapet,
which is used as a promenade, is strongly recommended; it will
have a tendency to enliven the spirits, and brace the
nerves.&nbsp; On the south side of the Harbour is a fine Graving
Dock, admirably constructed, and one of the first in
England.&nbsp; The Dock gates are protected by a spur projecting
from Turkey Shore to the northward 330 feet, on the east side of
the gates.&nbsp; The whole of the above improvements were
effected for about &pound;130,000&mdash;the Graving Dock about
&pound;12,000.&nbsp; Formerly the road to the Pier was through
the town; but Government constructed a new road on the margin of
the Pool or Basin, which covers an area of fifty or sixty acres,
and is filled with water at high tide, but dry at low water.</p>
<p>The anchorage ground outside the Harbour having been so much
raked by use that the anchors would not hold, several vessels
were in consequence lost.&nbsp; In 1831, a very strong chain of
300 feet in length was laid down across the entrance; so that
when a vessel now drags her anchor before the gale, she drives <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>forward until
she grapples the chain.&nbsp; This plan has been the means of
saving a number of vessels, and none have been on shore since it
was adopted.&nbsp; On the Pier there is a large capstan of great
power, for the use of the Government Packets and other
vessels.&nbsp; Many large ships, by the aid of a plentiful supply
of warps, have been brought into the Harbour during heavy gales,
evidently snatched from destruction by the prompt assistance thus
rendered.&nbsp; A <span class="smcap">Life Boat</span> reposes on
a frame furnished with wheels, in order that it may be moved at
an instant&rsquo;s notice; a gratifying proof that the cause of
humanity is not suffered to slumber.</p>
<h3>GRAND TRIUMPHAL ARCH.</h3>
<p>The Triumphal Arch was erected to commemorate the arrival of
His Majesty George IV.&nbsp; On the 7th of August, 1821, His
Majesty landed at Holyhead, on his passage to Ireland; an event
which forms an epoch in the history of the Principality, and of
Anglesey in particular.&nbsp; Upwards of six centuries had
elapsed since a British Monarch was seen in Wales; but his
Majesty&rsquo;s visit was under circumstances widely different
from those which attended the visit of the first English
King.&nbsp; This auspicious day had been anxiously expected by
the natives of Holyhead for some time previously; and
preparations for His Majesty&rsquo;s reception had been made with
enthusiastic loyalty by every class of people.&nbsp; On the
appearance of the Royal Yacht, about half past four in the
evening, a signal was made from the top of Holyhead Mountain; but
the tide being contrary, and the wind light, the yacht and
attendant squadron could not approach the bay until 12
o&rsquo;clock, when they anchored directly opposite the town,
which was immediately illuminated.&nbsp; On the following day,
His Majesty landed on the shores of Cambria, and was
enthusiastically greeted by the cheers of thousands.&nbsp; The
confidence which His Majesty felt in the attachment of the loyal
and patriotic <i>Cambro-Britons</i> is strongly evinced in the
circumstance, that this was the first time of his being abroad
without a military escort.&nbsp; After remaining a short time on
the Pier, His Majesty and suite proceeded in three of the Marquis
of Anglesey&rsquo;s carriages to Plas Newydd.&nbsp; On His
Majesty&rsquo;s return to Holyhead, he was received at the
entrance of the town with similar attention and marks of respect
as were evinced on his landing; and he was conducted to his barge
amidst the reiterated cheers of the assembled multitude.&nbsp;
The squadron immediately manned their yards, royal salutes were
fired, and <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>the town was again illuminated.&nbsp; Being detained in
the bay by boisterous weather, the King left the Yacht, and
embarked in the Steam Packet <i>Lightning</i>, commanded by the
unfortunate Captain Skinner, (see page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page21">21</a></span>,) and
proceeded to the shores of Ireland.</p>
<p>As the visits of Monarchs are &ldquo;few and far
between,&rdquo; such an event was not to be lightly passed
over.&nbsp; A public meeting was held on the 9th of August, and a
general subscription was resolved to be entered into, for the
purpose of erecting a Triumphal Arch, commemorative of the
landing of His Majesty.&nbsp; On Wednesday, the 7th of August,
1822, the foundation stone was laid, with every circumstance that
was calculated to produce an impressive effect.&nbsp; On the 6th
of August, 1824, this elegant monument of loyalty was
opened.&nbsp; It is a chaste and beautiful structure, in the
Doric style, formed of Mona marble.&nbsp; It consists of four
handsome pillars, twenty feet high, which are placed two on
either side of a carriage-way, fourteen feet wide.&nbsp; Outside
of the pillars, and of the same height, are two rectangular
pillars, twelve feet by three feet six inches, leaving a footpath
on each side of the carriage-way of five feet.&nbsp; The whole is
surmounted with a bold and projecting cornice, and covered over
by three diminishing tiers of masonry, forming a platform.&nbsp;
Over the carriage-way, on either side, are empannelled
inscriptions, in Welsh and Latin, commemorative of the event.</p>
<h3>HOLYHEAD LIGHT-HOUSE.</h3>
<p>The Light-house at the end of the Pier is one of the finest
pieces of masonry in the kingdom&mdash;it is a master-piece of
the kind, and is proof against the most violent storms and
hurricanes by which it can be assailed.&nbsp; It is built of
Moelfre stone, a kind of marble, inside as well as outside, on an
inverted arch, and without any other timber than what was
necessary for the door cases and window frames.&nbsp; It consists
of three stories, or landing places, the ceilings of which are
groined, and the gloves are of smooth stone.&nbsp; The floors are
of rough polished stones.&nbsp; Its base is six feet above high
water mark, and is protected from the sea by a strong
glacis.&nbsp; The tower, which is circular, is thirty-three feet
in height to the gallery, and the lantern, which is ten feet
higher, is lighted with twenty brilliant lights of gas, having
reflectors plated with silver, and displaying a strong white
light in every direction, which being at an elevation of fifty
feet <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>above
the level of the sea, affords a safe guide to vessels approaching
the Harbour.&nbsp; There is a lamp, with reflector, placed
opposite an aperture, twenty feet below the lantern, shewing a
red light.&nbsp; This is not seen by vessels until they have
cleared all rocks outside, when it at once appears, and the
vessel alters her course, and runs for the Pier-head with
confidence.&nbsp; In thick weather the packets are guided by
signal guns and bells, which are so well arranged that sometimes
the Pier Light-house has been the first object seen after
crossing the channel from Ireland.</p>
<h3>MONUMENT TO CAPTAIN SKINNER.</h3>
<p class="poetry">There&rsquo;s a Divinity that shapes our
ends,<br />
Rough-hew them as we will.</p>
<p>This gallant officer, formerly commander of a post-office
packet on the Holyhead station, lost his life, in 1833, by being
washed overboard in an almost unaccountable manner, while
standing on his own vessel speaking to one of his sailors, who
was carried away by the same wave with his captain, and both
ultimately disappeared.&nbsp; It is said the weather was not very
boisterous, and that the accident was one of the most
extraordinary ever known in the annals of naval experience.</p>
<p>The obelisk monument, erected by public subscription, to the
memory of the estimable and noble-spirited officer, is now to be
seen on the rocks south of the harbour.&nbsp; He was generally
respected, and his loss greatly regretted by his numerous
friends.&nbsp; Surely no one can visit this generous, humane, and
affecting tribute of regard, without reflecting on the solemn and
sudden visitations of an inscrutable Providence, as exemplified
in the untimely end of the brave and benevolent Capt.
Skinner.</p>
<h3>THE CAPTAIN&rsquo;S GRAVE.</h3>
<blockquote><p>No sculptured slab of marble rare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Captain&rsquo;s grave discloses;<br />
No flattering strain of praise records<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where his pale corse reposes;<br />
No weeping kindred o&rsquo;er his bier<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With praises laud the brave;<br />
No floweret gemmed with memory&rsquo;s tear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Proclaims the Captain&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Wrapped
in a shroud of pale sea flowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep in a rocky grot,<br />
The clay-cold form lies silently,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where man disturbeth not.<br />
No solemn train of funeral pomp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He died as died the brave;<br />
The fond hope of a hardy crew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rests calm below the wave.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>SKERRIES LIGHT-HOUSE.</h3>
<p>The Skerries are a group of bare or half covered rocks, eight
or ten in number, about nine miles from Holyhead, and two miles
from the northern extremity of the Isle of Anglesey.&nbsp; It is
called in Welsh, <i>Ynys y Moelrhoniaid</i>, or the <i>Isle of
Seals</i>, from the great number of seals seen about it.&nbsp; It
is inhabited by a few poor sheep, and a numerous colony of
rabbits.&nbsp; The length of the Island is about a quarter of a
mile; it is greatly indented at the sides, and at high water is
even divided into a number of smaller insulated rocks.&nbsp; In
fine weather it has a most dreary appearance, and in high winds
the breaking of the sea against its rugged base, and the immense
clouds of foam which darken the air, render the ocean
inexpressibly awful and terrific.&nbsp; A bay light, to mark the
situation of a cluster of dangerous rocks at the north entrance
of Holyhead, was first placed here in 1730, for the convenience
of ships navigating between the ports of Liverpool, Bristol, and
Ireland.&nbsp; The present Light-house was erected, and the first
<i>oil</i>-light exhibited, in 1804.&nbsp; Before that time coals
were used, of which a great fire was kept burning in the conical
grate, which appears on the summit of the front peak of the
rock.&nbsp; The light from this beacon may be seen 25 or 30 miles
off, and is of infinite service to navigation; for, prior to its
erection, scarce a winter passed here without shipwrecks, and
nearly always accompanied with loss of lives, for the surge beats
against it with incredible fury.&nbsp; Fish sport about the sides
of this island in amazing multitudes; they are principally the
colefish, the whiting, pollocks, and the cod-fish.&nbsp; The
beautiful corasses, &amp;c., are caught here.&nbsp; Puffins
resort to this place in great plenty; they come in a surprising
manner, all in a flock in one night, and, when their season
arrives, depart in the same manner.&nbsp; Those who love the bold
and awful rather than the calm scenes of nature, will do well to
visit this island.</p>
<h3><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>SOUTH
STACK&mdash;BY LAND.</h3>
<blockquote><p>On <span class="smcap">South Stack</span> rock
what glories feast our eyes,<br />
Entrance our senses and our souls surprise!<br />
To paint each scene no colours can be found,<br />
Romantic beauties crowd the enchanted ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>South Stack may be visited either by land or water; cars and
boats may be hired at a moderate charge.&nbsp; The way by land is
the mountain road, as far as a farm called <i>Glan yr Afon</i>,
(river side) and then across the mountain to the heights directly
opposite.</p>
<h3>THE LIGHT-HOUSE</h3>
<p>Is erected on an island, or rather the summit of an isolated
rock, from which it takes its name, situated at the south west
point of Holyhead mountain, and about four miles from the
town.&nbsp; This splendid structure was commenced in the month of
August, 1808; and the light was first exhibited on the night of
the 9th of February, 1809, and is of essential service in
facilitating the access to the Holyhead Harbour.&nbsp; It was
built at the sole expense of the Corporation of Trinity House,
London.&nbsp; The light is a revolving one, displaying a
full-faced light every two minutes, which, in clear weather, is
distinctly visible at a distance of ten leagues.&nbsp; The frame
that is attached to the pivot on which the Argand lamps is fixed
is triangular, having seven brilliant lamps and powerful
reflectors on each side or face.&nbsp; The different lamps which
illuminate by night have behind them large brass reflectors,
lined with silver, and kept in a state of unsullied
brilliance.&nbsp; The angles of the triangle, being all acute,
the light cannot be seen when any of them points towards an
object which is more than a league distant.&nbsp; This affords to
mariners the means of distinguishing it from the Skerries Light,
distant from the South Stack about nine miles.&nbsp; A moveable
red light is also placed for the use of the government
packets.</p>
<p>The elevation of the summit of the rock on which the
Lighthouse is erected, is 140 feet above the level of the sea at
high water mark; the height of the tower, from the base to the
gallery, is 60 feet, and the lantern is 12 feet from the gallery,
making the total elevation of the light 212 feet above high water
mark, and is visible over the whole of Carnarvon Bay.&nbsp; The
whole of this establishment was under the able superintendence of
Captain H. Evans, who first pointed out the necessity of erecting
a light <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>on
this spot, and whose name is imperishably connected with Holyhead
and its vicinity.</p>
<p>From the summit of the cliff, from which the island and
Lighthouse appear but diminutive objects, a zig-zag flight of
steps, 365 in number, (as many steps as there are days in the
year) are cut in the side of the mountain, secured by a parapet,
so as to afford an easy descent to the nearest part of the rock
on a level with the island.&nbsp; The descent to the suspension
bridge, which spans the sound below, affords a variety of
interesting views.&nbsp; Each winding in the face of the rock
gives a change of scenery terrific and sublime.&nbsp; In the
summer months the sea-fowl are very numerous, thousands will be
seen hovering round the huge rocks and caverns of which the coast
is composed, and contribute much to impress the minds of visitors
with a due sense of the grandeur and sublimity of the
scene.&nbsp; After a few turnings, and expressions of surprise,
in reference to the romantic scenery, the numerous birds wheeling
in every direction, and their plaintive cry&mdash;the bridge will
be attained.&nbsp; Once upon a time, before the suspended bridge
was there, ferry-boats made an occasional passage to the
Light-house, but the rough seas caused by the strong tides, about
the Head, rendered the communication by boat very
precarious.&nbsp; In order to obviate the danger, a passage was
contrived by means of two ropes thrown across the gulf, along
which the individual was drawn in a box or cradle, five feet in
length, by the assistance of pullies affixed at each end, his
body hanging down, and the bellowing ocean raging below to
swallow him, if the tackling did not hold him secure.&nbsp; This
plan was superseded by a bridge of ropes, which was used some
years after, and although considered perfectly safe and
convenient, was by no means agreeable to the affrighted Tourist,
but it seldom happened that it became an obstacle in the way of
those who wished to visit the Light-house.&nbsp; The present
Suspension Bridge which connects the South Stack rock with the
Head, was formed in 1827.&nbsp; It is over a chasm 110 feet in
width, and built on the same principle as the Menai Bridge, two
chain cables passing across, firmly fixed in the rocks on either
side, and carried over two massive stone pillars erected for the
purpose.&nbsp; The chain supports the platform of timber five
feet wide, and 70 feet above high-water mark.&nbsp; The crossing
of the bridge to some will be a little trying to the
nerves.&nbsp; The thunders of the rolling flood below are enough
to make the heart tremble, particularly when the wind blows
briskly.&nbsp; The fairer portion of <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>visitors, in virtue of the
balloon-like construction of their attire, will more particularly
court the notice of rude Boreas, and ere they can successfully
battle with this bold and ungallant deity, they must exercise
their ingenuity, and reef sails as well as circumstances will
admit; they then, as boldly as any lord of the creation, face the
warring element, and arrive safely upon the opposite crag.</p>
<p>Having reached the Light-house, and ascended its steep and
rocky stairs, the steps of which number 80, you may gaze, from
the summit, on the wilderness of waters around; observe the
myriads of gulls and guillemots, standing on the edge of the
rocks, or flying about in all directions; see the Telegraph, and
gaze upon the ever-varying ocean, enlivened by numerous vessels
passing up or down the channel.&nbsp; On returning, a little
exertion will be required to scale the towering acclivity, but
the labour is not felt between the bracing effects of the
atmosphere, and the excitement.&nbsp; An occasional
moment&rsquo;s pause, for breathing purposes, will afford the
visitor a fine opportunity for inhaling the balmy and
invigorating air; and I would advise the visitor to draw long
breaths for the pleasure of it.</p>
<p>Previous to the erection of this Light-house, scores of
vessels had, from time to time, been on shore at the back of the
Head, in many of which instances all on board had perished; but
since its erection it has been the means of saving from
destruction several valuable lives, and many hundred thousand
pounds&rsquo; worth of property.</p>
<h3>SOUTH STACK&mdash;BY WATER.</h3>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocks,<br
/>
Which raise their crested heads into the clouds,<br />
Piled in sublimity, create a scene<br />
More grand, more soothing to the pensive soul<br />
Than Rome with all its splendour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost at all hours of the day the service of steady and
experienced watermen may be engaged at the Harbour.&nbsp; The
little pinnace, with its white sail, will soon be ready to convey
you on your cruise.&nbsp; I scarcely need remark, that in order
to enjoy the trip, the atmosphere must be clear and the weather
calm.&nbsp; The Tourists having taken their seats in their snug
boat, will no sooner have given the well-known signal, &ldquo;all
right,&rdquo; than the stout seamen will take to their oars, with
long and strong pulls, and in a few minutes they will find
themselves smoothly gliding on the crystal flood, across the
beautiful and spacious Bay; and <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>should the boatmen be in merry mood,
they may enliven the scene by singing</p>
<h3>MY NATIVE BAY.</h3>
<p class="poetry">My Native Bay is calm and bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As ere it was of yore,<br />
When, in the days of hope and love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood upon its shore;<br />
The sky is glowing, soft, and blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As once in youth it smiled,<br />
When summer seas and summer skies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were always bright and mild.</p>
<p class="poetry">The sky&mdash;how oft hath darkness dwelt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then upon its breast;<br />
The sea&mdash;how oft have tempests broke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its gentle dream of rest!<br />
So oft hath darker wo come o&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Calm self-enjoying thought;<br />
And passion&rsquo;s storms a wilder scene<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within my bosom wrought.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, after years of absence, passed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In wretchedness and pain,<br />
I come and find those seas and skies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All calm and bright again.<br />
The darkness and the storm from both<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have trackless passed away;<br />
And gentle as in youth, once more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou seem&rsquo;st my Native Bay.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh that, like thee, when toil is over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all my griefs are past,<br />
This ravaged bosom might subside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To peace and joy at last!<br />
And while it lay all calm like thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In pure unruffled sleep,<br />
Oh! might a Heaven as bright as this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be mirrored in its deep.</p>
<p>On the left is the New Harbour, to the right the Skerries
Light-house, before you St. George&rsquo;s Channel.&nbsp; As you
draw near the rocks you gain a full and varied view of the
scene.&nbsp; In wildness and grandeur of aspect no place,
assuredly, can surpass this portion of the Anglesey coast.&nbsp;
Here nature exhibits her rude outline in the most sublime and
magnificent scenery.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
us go round,<br />
And let the sail be slack, the course be slow,<br />
That at our leisure, as we coast along,<br />
We may contemplate, and from every scene<br />
Receive its influence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>As you
advance, the grand promontory, with its towering precipitous
cliffs&mdash;its crags, fretted by decay and storm&mdash;its
magnificent caverned rocks, and bleak indented sides, appear to
the utmost advantage.&nbsp; The effect, as you draw nearer and
nearer within the verge of these tremendous caverns, is truly
appalling; at last, when you come under the black shadows of the
super-ambient rocks, and approach the dismal chasms, and hear the
wild plaintive cry of the sea-birds, wheeling above your heads,
it is impossible not to feel sensations equally unexpected and
solemn.&nbsp; Grand receding arches of different shapes,
supported by gigantic pillars of rock, formed by the incessant
action of the waves, which, in stormy weather, roll with terrific
violence against this high rocky coast, and exhibit a strange
magnificence&mdash;a wild and savage beauty, mingle with a dread
repose which continues to haunt the imagination even after
quitting the scene.&nbsp; The singular and fantastic shapes and
positions of these rocky formations, either primitive or
time-worn, pinnacled or projecting, running off in bold
escapement, or shelving into sheet-like floors of
granite&mdash;sometimes yawning in chasms too deep for the light
of summer&rsquo;s sun to reach, or rounded into Amphitheatres
that might have formed the council hall of a race of giants,
gleaming in the hues of grey, green, and purple, lying in ribbon
streaks, or mingled in rich combination&mdash;all, all, lies
immediately before you.&nbsp; The largest of these caverns is
peculiarly worth attention; it has received the vulgar
appellation of the <i>Parliament House</i>, from the frequent
visits of water parties to see this wonderful cavern; it being
only accessible by boats, and that at half ebb-tide.&nbsp; It is
entered through a noble arch about 70 feet high, and consists of
a series of receding arches, supported by massive and lofty
pillars of rock, displaying an interior of picturesque and
sublime grandeur.&nbsp; It is a magnificent instance of the
effects of the sea, in producing beautiful or fantastic forms
from the soluble parts of stratified rocks, more especially where
calcareous substances are prevalent in their composition.&nbsp;
Not far from this cavern the face edges to the sea slightly
divided, resembling a facade of slender columns, descending from
an elevation of 250 feet perpendicular to the sea.&nbsp; The
whole promontory is chloride schist, in strata of about six
feet.&nbsp; Seated among these rocks, or whirling in circles
above and around you, are various sea-fowls which seek these
solitary abodes.&nbsp; You cannot look upon them without an
interest seldom inspired by the tamer species; whether curlews,
gulls, razorbills, guillimots, cormorants, or <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>herons, there
is something wild and eccentric in their habits and appearance,
which produces ideas of solitude and freedom; for we feel that
they are not our slaves, but commoners of nature.&nbsp;
Occasionally may be seen on one of the loftiest rocks a peregrine
falcon, in high repute when falconry was in fashion&mdash;one of
those feudal warriors who has survived his fame, no longer the
companion of courts and courtly halls.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are few objects more interesting than the
appearance of the South Stack, when approaching it by
water&mdash;the Light-house towering, 212 feet above the level of
the sea&mdash;the sound of life and industry&mdash;mingled with
the lashing of the sea, and the cry of innumerable birds, are
altogether of so unwonted a character, that if you were
transported to the antipodes you would not feel more unfeigned
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The traveller,&rdquo; (observes Dr. Stanley, late
Bishop of Norwich) &ldquo;by day, in his passage up or down the
Channel, near the eastern shores, must have observed a white
tower, posted like a sentinel, on the brow of a low hammock,
apparently forming a projecting ledge from the seaward base of
Caer Gybi, or the Mountain of Holyhead.&nbsp; On approaching
still nearer, he will perceive that this hammock, is, in fact, an
island, torn from the main mass, but connected therewith by a
link, at a distance resembling the gauze-work of a gossamer,
which in its fall, had accidentally caught upon the corresponding
projections of the disjointed rocks.&nbsp; Let him look a little
longer, and he will now and then detect minute objects to and
fro, and come to the obvious conclusion that this aerial pathway
is neither more nor less than a connecting ladder of
accommodation formed by the hand of man.&nbsp; The speck by
night, the white tower by day, with its hammock and fairy bridge,
comprise what is called South Stack, and, taken together it forms
a prominent feature in the bold, romantic scenery of this
iron-bound coast, and combines so many objects worthy of notice,
natural and artificial, that be the observer what he may, poet,
philosopher, or naturalist, he will find wherewithal to excite
his curiosity, and reward his labour, in visiting a <i>spot which
has not many rivals in its kind in the wide world</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tourist by this time will be convinced that the
description given in these pages is not over-coloured, not
chimerical; for I am fully persuaded, that no one can visit this
magnificent scenery without wishing for a vocabulary varied and
rich as the Alpine aspect before him; but language supplies no
expressions <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>that could paint the effect of the whole assemblage upon
his mind.&nbsp; A painter might here use his pencil with effect,
and a poet indulge himself in his sublimities.&nbsp; But what are
high and impending rocks&mdash;what are the giant heavings of an
angry ocean&mdash;and what the proudest summit of the Andes, when
placed in the scale of such interminable vastness as the
creating, balancing, and peopling of innumerable globes?&nbsp; In
contemplating systems so infinite, who can forbear
exclaiming&mdash;What a mole-hill is our earth, and how
insignificant are we who creep so proudly on her surface.</p>
<h3>SOUTH STACK SEA-BIRDS.</h3>
<p class="poetry">More fleet, on nimble-wing, the gull<br />
Sweeps booming by, intent to cull<br />
Voracious, from the billow&rsquo;s breast,<br />
Marked far away, his destined feast;<br />
Behold him now deep plunging dip<br />
His sunny pinions sable tip<br />
In the green wave; now lightly skim<br />
With whirling flight the water&rsquo;s brim,<br />
Wave in the blue sky his silver sail<br />
Aloft, and frolic in the gale,<br />
Or sink again his breast to lave,<br />
And float upon the foaming wave;<br />
Oft o&rsquo;er his form your eyes may roam,<br />
Not know him from the feathery foam,<br />
Nor &rsquo;mid the rolling waves, your ear<br />
On yelling blast, his clamour hear.</p>
<p>Though but a small number amongst the many who direct their
steps to South Stack may have turned their attention to
ornithology, yet none visit this romantic spot without expressing
their unqualified admiration in reference to the thousands of
sea-birds which perform their rapid circumlocutions in every
direction, filling the air with their shrill screaming
voices.&nbsp; Presuming, therefore, that a few remarks on the
natural history of these aquatic tribes may not be deemed
uninteresting, we give the following information concerning some
of them.</p>
<p>We would, however, first observe, that we cannot complain of
want of music on the sea-shore, for wind and wave make there a
constant melody; but we rarely listen, when near the sea, to the
voice of a singing-bird; such birds are uttering their joy far
away over the corn fields, or among the leafy boughs of the deep
green woodland, or in the stillness of the meadow, or among the
water sedges.&nbsp; But if the voices of our sea-birds are <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>not in
themselves musical, they please us by their association with the
rude and wild scenes around us, and by their fitness for their
haunts.&nbsp; Of little use to the sea-bird would be the sweet
clear tones of the nightingale or the lark.&nbsp; Loud as they
seem to us when uttered amid the stillness of the country, they
would hardly be heard over the sea, and would be of small service
as a language to the winged creatures whose homes are rocky
precipices, ever dashed against by loud-sounding waves.&nbsp; To
these the screaming hoarse voices of the sea-gulls are far better
attuned, and these are indeed the only utterances which could
avail them amidst the storm.</p>
<p>Nor is this powerful voice of the sea-bird the only fitness
for its haunts which is presented to our minds as we look and
listen.&nbsp; Besides that it possesses, in common with all
birds, that wonderful power of vision, without which it could
neither direct its flight with safety, nor gain any idea of
distance or motion, it has immense strength of wing; and such
species as the sea-gulls, which are destined to live on water
rather than land, have small legs and feet; while such as are
made like the curlew, to roam the marshes, have long legs,
adapted for walking and wading in among them.</p>
<h3>SEA GULLS.</h3>
<p>No bird is better known, on most parts of our coast, than the
common gull, which is in some places called the winter-mew.&nbsp;
Active and restless as it may seem on the wing, it has, when in
repose, little that would remind us of the frequent comparison,
&ldquo;blithe as a bird.&rdquo;&nbsp; We sometimes see it in
gardens near the coast, with clipped wings, wandering in solitude
over the paths with dejected and melancholy air, as if pining for
its native sea and its companions.&nbsp; When free, its manners
seem almost agitated as it darts eagerly on its prey, swallowing
it so impetuously that it sometimes seizes the hook and bait
which the fisherman has put out to take the fish, and thus wounds
itself and becomes a captive.&nbsp; Buffon calls the clamorous
and voracious gulls the vultures of the sea; they not only feed
on fish, molluscous and other living animals, but seize on dead
and putrid matter of every description, either floating on the
waters or spread on the shore.&nbsp; Gulls do not dive into the
water for food, but they dip now and then to seize it.&nbsp; They
have been found by voyagers in all latitudes, and are very
numerous in northern regions, where the carcases of whales and of
large fish offer them an abundant <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>store of nourishment.&nbsp; Hard and
tough as their flesh is, yet it may be eaten; and the eggs, which
are placed in large nests made of grass and sea-weeds, are very
good.&nbsp; The gull comes to South Stack in April or May, and
leaves in September.</p>
<h3>THE GUILLEMOT.</h3>
<p>Much of that loud, wild screaming which resounds among the
cliffs, and which sometimes rises shrill and hoarse, even above
the wildest roar of the sea, is made by some of those birds which
look like the diver, and which can also both swim and dive
exceedingly well.&nbsp; The common guillemot is commonly called
the foolish guillemot, or foolish Willie, or wild Willie; though
why it should be deemed inferior to other sea-birds in sense is
not very apparent, as it seems to surpass many of them in this
respect.&nbsp; It may be that when on shore the bird has an
awkward appearance, as the legs are placed so far back beneath
the body that they walk badly, and their wings are so short and
narrow that they can scarcely flutter.&nbsp; Let our bird,
however, but get upon the face of the waters, and we shall see it
swim with grace and ease, while the very position of its legs,
which renders it a bad walker, is suited to facilitate its
diving.&nbsp; It dives very low, and the wings aid its progress
as it rises to the surface when some tempting fish, or marine
insect, induces it to urge onwards with great rapidity.&nbsp; It
is by means of these short wings, too, that the guillemots clear
the projecting ledges of rocks and cliffs, and jump from point to
point, till they reach those high, and to us inaccessible, spots
where they often build.&nbsp; Its single egg is placed on the
bare rock.&nbsp; The guillemot visits South Stack about the month
of April, and by the month of September, both old and young,
leave the rocks, and make their dwellings, both by night and by
day, on that wide world of waters for which they are so admirably
fitted.</p>
<blockquote><p>Amidst the flashing and feathery foam<br />
The common guillemot finds a home;<br />
A home, if such a place can be<br />
For her who lives on the wide, wide sea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The migratory movement of birds may be regarded as one of the
most wonderful impulses possessed by animals, and it supplies an
apt illustration of the Prophet&rsquo;s view, when he reproached
the chosen nation of God for their neglect of appointed
duty.&nbsp; <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her
appointed time; and the turtle, and the crane, and the swallow,
observe the time of their coming: but my people know not the
judgment of the Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Jer.</i> viii. 7.</p>
<h3>REFLECTIONS ON THE THREE LIGHT-HOUSES.</h3>
<p>Light-houses, beacons, warning-bells, and the like, are among
the most indispensable adjuncts of maritime conveyance; without
them, indeed, it would be utterly impossible to conduct it with
anything like regularity or safety; and if there be one thing
more than another that has given me pleasure while writing these
pages, it is that of recording <i>three light-houses</i> (viz.,
South Stack, Skerries, and Holyhead) connected with the thriving
Port of Holyhead.&nbsp; If it would not be deemed too figurative
and fanciful, I should denominate these light-houses&mdash;<span
class="GutSmall">BRILLIANT EYES LOOKING OUT FOR THE RETURN OF THE
WEATHER-BEATEN SONS OF THE OCEAN</span>.&nbsp; What vast
improvements have been made in this, as well as in other
departments of nautical affairs!&nbsp; Humanity, as well as
interest, led to the adoption of light-houses, both as beacons
and guides; and it speaks well for the sympathy and benevolence
of Britons that there are on and about the British coasts upwards
of 200 light-houses, which are classed as &ldquo;harbour
lights&rdquo; and &ldquo;general lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first attempts were rude; common fires, first of wood, and
then of coals, were originally used to furnish light.&nbsp; A
coal fire was employed for this purpose in the Isle of Man for
180 years (as late as the year 1816).&nbsp; Tallow candles
succeeded;&mdash;candles fastened on wooden rods were burnt in
the Eddystone light-house for 40 years after it was completed by
Smeaton; then came lamps with twisted cotton wicks.&nbsp; The
glimmering lamps of by-gone days have disappeared, and are
superseded by Argand lamps, with lenses and reflecting
prisms.&nbsp; The hand of science has extinguished the faint
splendours of the last century, and lighted up midnight suns,
fixing them in their furbished orbits, on elegant structures,
high in aerial heaven, whose reflected rays mingle together, so
as to form one concentrated blaze of light, intense and
beautiful, illuminating and adorning the shore and rock.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable light-houses in England is the
Eddystone, erected on a solitary rock, opposite the coast of
Plymouth: it has withstood many a terrific tempest, and appears
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>likely to
stand firm amid the elemental wars for years to come.&nbsp; Not
unfrequently, at the mouth of harbours, as at Harwich, two
light-houses are erected, one more elevated than the other; one
to guide the vessels in their approach to the coast, and the
other to direct them in their entrance to the harbour.</p>
<p>Not far from the room where I am now writing, break the waves
of St. George&rsquo;s Channel.&nbsp; I hear the roar&mdash;it is,
indeed, a stormy night&mdash;wild blows the wind,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I think of the mariner tossed on the billow,<br />
Afar from the home of his childhood and youth;<br />
No mother to watch o&rsquo;er his sleep-broken pillow,<br />
No father to counsel&mdash;no sister to soothe! <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tide of joy rises in my soul at the thought that, close to
my own door, I can gaze upon two light-houses, one of which is,
mid the foaming deep, presenting a brilliant point of
light&mdash;a distinct and striking object&mdash;though some nine
miles of waters are rolling between us.&nbsp; It is the
<i>Skerries Light-house</i>.&nbsp; I love to look at it.&nbsp;
Its <i>constancy</i> and <i>fixedness</i> interest me.&nbsp; No
sooner are the last rays of the sun retiring from land and sea,
than the watchful keeper hastens to kindle the beacon.&nbsp; If
to the midnight hour I protract my musings, and cast a glance
upon the sea, there shines the light.&nbsp; If long before the
dawn of day I have arisen to my labours, there it still
shines.&nbsp; The week, the month, the year rolls round, and
there is no failure.&nbsp; What deeply interesting facts are
announced by that brilliant light; it is as if an angel of mercy,
with a voice of thunder, stood and announced what part it was of
a dangerous coast to which the mariner was most contiguous, and
in which direction he must look for shoal and breaker.&nbsp; He
is kindly told when there is peril, and when safety.&nbsp; There
is language in that radiance which streams far forth upon the
dark, deep sea.&nbsp; Facts of highest moment are announced by
it.&nbsp; The whole surrounding region of shore and <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>sea is
suggested to the sailor by that welcome light.&nbsp; There it
stands&mdash;a beacon against danger, and a guide to the desired
haven.&nbsp; For the erection and maintenance of light-houses, a
rate is levied on all vessels passing them within certain limits,
this rate varying from one farthing to one penny per ton for each
light so passed.</p>
<p>Let the reader picture to himself the advantage of
light-houses, when the storm is up&mdash;when the bright beacons
send forth their refulgent beams through the blackness of
tempest, on the dark winter night.&nbsp; Who can say how many
mariners owe their lives to their friendly warnings.&nbsp; The
vessels that are wrecked through want of light-houses are
recorded; but there is no record of the greater number which, no
doubt, light-houses have saved.&nbsp; Melancholy indeed would be
the consequences were all the lighthouses to be
extinguished.&nbsp; What would become of our ships and our
sailors?&nbsp; How dreary a scene would be presented,&mdash;the
hope of the sailor would be wrecked, and dismal despair would sit
on the countenances of the navigators of the sea.&nbsp; The swift
ship approaches&mdash;the mariner looks for the friendly beacon;
but it is gone!&nbsp; There is no voice to announce the presence
of peril, and, for want of it, the noble vessel strikes the rock,
and all the horrors of shipwreck ensue.&nbsp; Shine on, thou
brilliant beacon of the perilous path of the mariner!&nbsp; Thou
canst not rival the bright luminary of the sky, but a noble
office canst thou do for seafaring men.</p>
<blockquote><p>I love the light that streams afar to save<br />
The storm-tossed seaman from the &rsquo;whelming wave;<br />
The ocean-beacon and the river-ranger,<br />
That lures from evil, and that warns from danger.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>A STROLL TO THE MOUNTAIN TELEGRAPH.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Placed on this mount, what various views
delight<br />
The ravished soul, and captivate the sight!<br />
Lo! yonder mountains high o&rsquo;er mountains rise,<br />
Each higher than the last, the highest strike the skies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beauty of rural scenery has engaged the attention and been
the theme of the poet and novelist under every clime and in every
nation, from the arctic regions of the North to the burning
tropics of the South.&nbsp; It arouses the slumbering energies of
the mind, pours delight into the heart, and beguiles the
languishing understanding by its smiling, soothing, refreshing
loveliness, and <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>wonderful effect.&nbsp; Where is there a man so callous
who has not felt the vivifying influence of nature, when the
summer&rsquo;s sun in his meridian glory shoots abroad his
dazzling rays over many a fair and beautiful prospect, animating
everything with the warmth of his genial fire.&nbsp; The view is
not bounded by tall houses and slooping roofs, between which we
can only get a bird&rsquo;s eye view of a narrow strip of sky,
but we see across the fields, and meadows, and landscape, for
many miles, to a distant horizon, where sky, and earth, and sea
seem to meet, strongly reminding one of the following poetic
dash:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">God made the country,
and man made the town.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In tracing the beauties of old Cambria through its length and
breadth, but few spots have given a more pleasing idea of its
graces than those seen from the summit of Holyhead Mountain,
which is nearly 800 feet above the level of the sea.&nbsp; Though
it cannot boast of the wonders of the untrodden glaciers of
Switzerland, the mighty Alps, the stupendous Andes, and the
Himalaya of other hemispheres, still the mountain partakes
sufficiently of the magnitude to impress the beholder with
feelings of awe and admiration.&nbsp; If not on the largest
scale, it can yet boast almost every variety of the noblest
characteristics of mountain scenery, even to the terrible.&nbsp;
Let the visitor make up his mind</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">To face the breeze and
catch its sweetness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let him, pointing to the pomp of mountain summit, inspire his
companions in travel by exclaiming</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Now for our mountain
sport&mdash;up yon hill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stroll, which is only from two to three miles, will be
most delightful.&nbsp; On reaching the base of the mountain, I
may just remind you, that</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">To climb steep hills
requires slow pace at first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are a lover of nature many objects will attract your
attention, and beguile your moments, as you ascend higher and
higher.&nbsp; Do you take a pleasure in <i>Botany</i>?&nbsp;
There are the <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>shrub, bush, diversified flowers, and rare plants,
emitting a reviving fragrance; and there is not</p>
<blockquote><p>A plant, a leaf, a blossom, but contains<br />
A folio volume.&nbsp; You may read, and read,<br />
And read again, and still find something new.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you delight in the study of <i>Ornithology</i>?&nbsp; There
is the lark soaring high, and pouring forth his lovely notes, and
other songsters of the feathered tribes in varied music warbling
their wildest notes; and it is hardly an unnatural suggestion,
that a new laid egg has cleared the rejoicing throat of the
cuckoo that is loudly exulting.&nbsp; Has <i>Entomology</i> any
attractions for you?&nbsp; There is the <i>humble-bee</i>
pursuing his busy course, too happy to keep his joy to himself,
humming aloud while on the wing; but suspending his monotonous
song, if song it may be called, the moment he alights upon a
flower.&mdash;The <i>butterfly</i> of no common kind fluttering
up and down the air with his companion, banquetting on pleasure
in the sunny beams, enjoying its fourth state of existence.&nbsp;
Stand and gaze for a moment on that pretty rainbow-tinted
creature; and as you look, consider the different grades of its
existence,&mdash;metamorphosis to its final
transformation,&mdash;the egg of the butterfly has one life, and
the caterpillar which springs from it has another, and the
chrysalis into which the caterpillar changes has a third, and the
gay butterfly which rises from the chrysalis has a
fourth;&mdash;then there is the <i>gossamer spider</i>, which has
just covered the bush with its webs in every direction, and while
spangling with dew, and trembling in the breeze, they glitter in
the sun-light like some silver tissue woven with gems; and
unnumbered species of insects, of peculiar kind, may be seen
buzzing and flying, creeping and jumping, above, around,
beneath;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And each, within its little bulk, contains<br />
A heart, which drives the torrents through its veins;<br />
Muscles to move its limbs aright; a brain<br />
And nerves disposed for pleasure and for pain:<br />
Eyes to distinguish; sense whereby they know<br />
What&rsquo;s good or bad; is, or is not, its foe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the tourist a <i>Geologist</i>?&nbsp; Here are unnumbered
stones, of different sizes, shapes, and colours, which Nature
appears to have thrown up in one of her wildest freaks.&mdash;Is
he an <i>Antiquarian</i>?&nbsp; If he will follow the path
chalked out in these pages, <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>he will find materials which will
furnish him with an intellectual repast, before he leaves the
mountain.&nbsp; But more of this anon.</p>
<p>What are these mast-like things just a-head, peeping over the
mountain&rsquo;s brow?&nbsp; A few more steps, enquiring
traveller, and they will answer for themselves.&nbsp; Another
minute, and you will reach the breathing point.&nbsp; The
panoramic view that suddenly opens, after gaining the eminence,
baffles all description.&nbsp; You will feel a thrill of pleasure
as you stand and gaze on the majestic ocean, ruffled by the
breeze, giving back the sun-beam from ten thousand glittering
waves, rolling clear and deep, carrying on her liquid bosom her
rich and varied burdens.&nbsp; While, however, you form a Pic Nic
for a few minutes, I will amuse you with the following apposite
poetic effusion:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE TOURIST&rsquo;S PIC NIC.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Now welcome May comes brightly in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With sunny shower and azure sky;<br />
Come, quit the city&rsquo;s dust and din<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere yet the season&rsquo;s freshness fly.<br />
This is a spot of ancient turf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The grass is purely fresh and green;<br />
Just within hearing of the surf:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Few lovelier spots than this, I ween,<br />
Both land and sea in prospect fair,<br />
Well have a merry <i>Pic Nic</i> here.</p>
<p>Come woo we nature&rsquo;s loveliness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her landscapes fair, her scenes sublime,<br />
While young and lightsome footsteps press<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh odours from the mountain thyme.<br />
&rsquo;Tis good to be where old and young<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In social happiness are met,<br />
And every heart to mirth is strung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if life&rsquo;s sunshine ne&rsquo;er would
set.<br />
The younger folk shall dance and sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The older chat of bye-gone times;<br />
Or poet of the party bring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tribute of some idle rhymes.<br />
Let every one dismiss dull care<br />
And have a happy <i>Pic Nic</i> here.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>THE SIGNAL OR SEMAPHORIC TELEGRAPH.</h3>
<p>This is a most ingenious invention, for the purpose of
carrying on a communication with distant persons.&nbsp; The line
of Telegraphs, or stations (eleven in number), was established by
the Trustees of the Liverpool Docks; they extend along the coast
as far as Liverpool, and are fixed on commanding heights, at an
average distance of a little less than eight miles apart.&nbsp; A
constant look-out <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>is kept during the day at each of these stations.&nbsp;
The rapidity with which a communication is made from Holyhead
mountain to Liverpool, a distance of about 80 miles, is truly
astonishing.&nbsp; A question is sometimes asked at Liverpool,
and an answer received from Holyhead in less than a
minute,&mdash;on some occasions in 30 seconds.&nbsp; The ordinary
intelligence of what ships are in sight, &amp;c., is generally
conveyed in 5 minutes.&nbsp; The Telegraph consists of two
vertical columns.&nbsp; Each of these columns is provided with
two pairs of arms, moveable on pivots, at a sufficient distance
from each other to prevent any confusion in the working.&nbsp;
There are thus eight arms, which, when out of operation or
indicating a cipher, or the ciphers required in expressing
hundreds and thousands, are invisible within the mast.&nbsp; Each
arm is capable of three points of elevation, and is worked from
below by means of chains hitched on to levers of a peculiar
construction.&nbsp; Any number, from 1 to 9, is indicated by one
or both of the arms being pointed obliquely or
horizontally.&nbsp; This arrangement of motion is applicable to
each of the four pairs of arms; but otherwise, each has a
different arithmetical power, indicating units, tens, hundreds,
thousands; so that the four powers in combination are capable of
exhibiting every number from 1 to 9,999; but in order to extend
the number still further, each mast is provided with an
indicator, or board, working vertically on its summit; these
indicators, when not in operation, being invisible.&nbsp; By this
means four series of numbers, from 1 to 9,999, may be obtained,
the telegraphic powers being extended to 39,996 signals.&nbsp;
Contiguous to this telegraph is one of older date, connected with
the Holyhead Harbour.</p>
<h3>THE EXTENSIVE PROSPECT FROM THE MOUNTAIN TELEGRAPH.</h3>
<p>By the aid of the excellent telescopes of the Telegraph, all
the more distant objects of attraction can be seen, and with a
singular mellowness.&nbsp; The South Stack Light-house is brought
so near, although about two miles off, as to make the
individuality of persons in the lantern (previously known) easily
and amusingly recognisable.&nbsp; Should the sky be unclouded and
the weather propitious, the natural scenery that presents itself
will be surpassingly grand.&nbsp; The view of the vast Snowdonian
amphitheatre of mountains&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">So shadowy, so
sublime,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>breaks like magic upon the eye, extending in one connected <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>Alpine chain
from the Irish Sea to the Bristol Channel, the contour of which
is varied, at irregular intervals, by the numerous diversified
peaks towering above the rest, till they gradually advance to the
summit of Snowdon, and then uniformly declining, till they
terminate in the North horn of Cardigan Bay.&nbsp; The Isle of
Anglesey, with her distant little hills and coasts, spread like a
map,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Lies smiling before
you;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that time-honoured Isle&mdash;a land of chivalry, of exciting
incident, of music and of song, of venerable tradition and
marvellous legend&mdash;the chief seat of the ancient
Druids&mdash;where the Princes of Wales had their Palace for
centuries.&nbsp; There the Picts, the Danes, the Irish, the
Saxons, and other warlike tribes,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">All armed in rugged
steel unfiled,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>pursued their conquests with great ferocity; ravaging the
Island with fire and sword, blood and slaughter, their banners
were</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Fanned by
conquest&rsquo;s crimson wing,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the hungry ravens reddened their beaks from the war of
men.&nbsp; From this mountainous throne may also be seen the Isle
of Man; Wicklow, the garden of Ireland; the mountains in the
county of Down, near the Bay of Dundrum; Bardsey Island; the
Cumberland hills, and parts of the Highlands of Scotland: the
vast expanding waters of the Carnarvon Bay, St. George&rsquo;s
Channel, and Holyhead Bay, roll before you.&nbsp; Below you lies
the Pier on Salt Island, with the Light-house on the
extremity&mdash;the New Harbour, with its whistling engines,
bustling workmen, and prancing horses; contiguous to which stand
the modern mansions erected for the accommodation of those whose
intellectual brains, like a main-spring, keep the stupendous
machinery in operation, and whose engineering mappings and
dottings, and sketchings and plannings, keep this corner of the
world wide awake&mdash;the Old Harbour, with its vessels and
smaller craft in different stages of preparation, and packets
busily preparing for immediate sail&mdash;the modest Obelisk
peeping over the town&mdash;the Skerry Rocks&mdash;the sea-washed
South Stack, and other objects of interest, open out on every
side perspicuously to the view.&nbsp; The painter would be at a
loss upon what particular spot to fix his eye; turn which way he
will, some beauty, variable and <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>exhaustless, is before him; it is
impossible for either the artist or poet to describe, with a hope
of doing anything like justice to, so picturesque and varied a
landscape.&nbsp; The impression is that of singular wildness and
solitude, stretching in a succession of prospects, fading into
distant softening vista, as agreeable to the eye as the
imagination.&nbsp; While standing on this promontory, your
thoughts flow poetically, although you have neither rhythm nor
music in your composition.</p>
<p>Having filled every cell in the lungs with exquisitely pure
air, that comes direct from a &ldquo;high ethereal
source&rdquo;&mdash;air so uncorrupted as to be met with only
far, far from the haunts of men, and the hum of human cities, we
must now bid farewell to this enchanting and enchaining spot, but
the scene will leave an undying impression on the mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love to stand upon the
hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And gaze on the ocean wide;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; See ships of commerce&mdash;not of war,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her bright bosom glide.<br />
But now before our eyes the mirror fades,<br />
Yet our strain&rsquo;d glance shall linger on the scene.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>A RAMBLE TO THE MOUNTAIN HEAD.</h3>
<blockquote><p>O! let us away to yon heights,<br />
Where the Roman encamp&rsquo;d him of old;<br />
With his train&rsquo;d bowmen and Knights,<br />
And his banner all burnish&rsquo;d with gold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having reluctantly turned our backs upon the Telegraph, we now
direct our steps to the mountain apex.&nbsp; The road is not
macadamized, but a romantic walk of 30 minutes will scarcely be
felt between the bracing effects of the atmosphere and the
excitement; and I feel assured that the antiquities will amply
repay the additional toil.&nbsp; From the summit there is a
commanding view of the Promontory, and you may mark its varying
breadth and inequalities, its storm indented figure, and its
broken fantastic cliffs, abrupt declivities, and deep gorges, as
by some earthquake cleft.</p>
<p>There is, indeed, a charm connected with this mount, before
which the pageant of pomp, and the heralds of emblazonry must bow
down.&nbsp; That charm is</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">The power of thought,
the magic of the mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What thoughts crowd upon the mind while standing on this <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>memorable
mountain!&nbsp; What triumphs and defeats have been experienced
here.&nbsp; Hope and despondency, pleasure and pain, have
alternately swelled the breasts of thousands mid these rocks,
while watching every movement of an adverse fleet, or the
approach of distant armies.&nbsp; The transactions of bye-gone
centuries pass in review before our eyes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Pen Caer Gybi stands renown&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Proud in song, and known in story;<br />
Where proud Rome in triumph frown&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the Welsh, who died in glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were the mighty fastnesses to which the ancient Britons
had recourse when overpowered by numbers and military tactics in
the plain.&nbsp; There is no wonder that these &ldquo;sons of the
mountain heroes&rdquo; so long successfully withstood the inroads
of Roman legions, when such craggy and adamantine rocks, were the
&ldquo;external circumstances&rdquo; in their &ldquo;formation of
character;&rdquo; and nothing less than the refined expedient of
powder and ball could dislodge them from these rocky fastnesses
and natural barricades; bows and arrows, swords and spears, were
only adapted for milder game, or closer quarters.&nbsp; On this
mountain our hardy ancestors stood and nobly fought, when liberty
made her last stand in this kingdom against the strides of Roman
power; their determination was</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">To leave the battle
only on their biers,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;to conquer or to die,&rdquo; and thousands fell</p>
<blockquote><p>Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and
unknown.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here we tread<br />
On sacred ground, and press the mingled dust of heroes;<br />
Far, far beneath they sleep, nor does a stone<br />
Or marble column rear its head to show<br />
The spot where now they moulder.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>ANTIQUITIES.</h3>
<p>There are several remains of military forts in this
neighbourhood, whose appearance indicates them to be of Roman
origin.&nbsp; While reviewing them our thoughts are instinctively
carried back to those days when the stranger tenanted the
land&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">When o&rsquo;er this
rugged mountain<br />
Rome&rsquo;s earliest legions past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the summit of the mountain called <i>Pen Caer Gybi</i>
(the <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Head
of Cybi&rsquo;s Fort) is a remarkable Roman antiquity, viz.:
<i>Caer Twr</i>, (Fort Tower).&nbsp; This circular building was
formerly strongly cemented with the same kind of mortar as the
Fort (church walls) of the Town, and supposed to have been a
<i>Roman Pharos</i>, or Watch Tower.&nbsp; It had stood and
braved the crushing thunder, vivid lightning, and warring winds
and storms, for perhaps sixteen hundred centuries.&nbsp; But the
rude hand of man has marred it, hoping by so doing to meet with
an Australian digging.</p>
<blockquote><p>Upon this mount a tower stands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well known in days of yore;<br />
When chieftains with their hostile bands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shed floods of human gore.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis now in ruins&mdash;but a spell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of grandeur haunts the scene;<br />
While none remain the deeds to tell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The deeds of blood there seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the side of the mountain runs a long dry wall, several
feet high in many places.&nbsp; The peculiar form of the wall
exhibits the Roman architect; and there is no doubt the Romans
had here one of their posts, or walled encampments.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is a power<br />
And magic in the ruined battlement<br />
For which the palace of the present hour<br />
Must yield, and wait, till ages are its dower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the opposite or West side of the mountain, and about ten
minutes&rsquo; walk from the Telegraph, on the right hand of the
footpath leading to South Stack, and in a situation awfully
romantic, may be seen traces of a religious house called <i>Capel
Lochwyd</i>.&nbsp; Here also the hand of man has effected a
greater demolition than the elemental war of many centuries; the
altar and walls have been removed with the hope of finding
treasure.&nbsp; It is worth while to visit this spot were it but
to admire the taste which these hermits of old had in fixing
their residence; and the piety, it may be, which led them to seek
a solitary abode so favourable to devotion.&nbsp; From this spot
has ascended the voice of prayer, and the hymn of praise.&nbsp; I
doubt not but the surrounding rocks have witnessed such acts of
self-denial, fervent devotion, and entire consecration to God as
would put many of us, who are making a flaming profession, to the
blush.&nbsp; I should imagine that <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>few could view these remarkable
remains of ancient piety without feeling, in some degree, the
sentiment so admirably expressed by the Poet&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
do love these ancient ruins;<br />
We never tread upon them but we set<br />
Our foot upon some reverend history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Close to this sacred spot is one of the most extraordinary
clefts in the solid rock ever seen by man.&nbsp; It would well
repay the walk of miles to see it.&nbsp; It was here the Welsh
lads and lasses of the last century descended and ascended, when
they tested their fortunes in reference to the profound hymeneal
question named in page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page17">17</a></span>.&nbsp; My friend who accompanied me
to view these ancient ruins, descended the ravine, but I
preferred remaining in meditative mood.&nbsp; The information,
however, which he gave, on returning, of the scenery of the
&ldquo;lower regions,&rdquo; created in my bosom a desire, which
I purpose, at some future period, should life be spared, to
gratify.&nbsp; It is a delightful walk from here to South Stack,
which may be accomplished in about half-an-hour.&nbsp; Many Roman
coins of the time of late emperors were found a few years ago in
this mountain; also several coins of Constantine the Great, in a
very perfect state, one of which was presented to the Marquis of
Anglesey by Captain H. Evans.&nbsp; In 1835, in removing some old
walls at <i>Ty Mawr</i> (Large House) the property of Lord
Stanley of Alderley, were found several spear-heads, axes, and
rings, of bronze, with red amber blades, which, from the form and
nature of the materials, appear to be of Ph&oelig;nician
origin.</p>
<p>It is a pity that ruins of such thrilling interest should have
been so shamefully demolished.&nbsp; As the number of visitors to
Holyhead will increase annually, it is hoped that efforts will be
made to restore some of them, for they will always be objects of
attraction.</p>
<p>By this time, I presume, you feel disposed for the &ldquo;good
things&rdquo; of this life, and cast a longing look towards your
quarters.&nbsp; Of one thing I am fully persuaded, that you will
feel your health better, your spirits brighter, your appetite
keener, your mind expanded, your thoughts assuming a loftier and
yet more refined bearing, from your having visited Nature in a
few of her sublimer abodes.</p>
<h3>REFLECTIONS.</h3>
<p>While descending the rugged mount, the scenes you have just
left behind may lead to a train of thought somewhat similar to <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the
following.&nbsp; What a great change has taken place in this
Island since the Roman Eagle fluttered in the breeze, and the
conquering legions rent the heavens with shouts of victory.&nbsp;
When the historic lamp disclosed this land, it presented a race
of rude barbarians,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Wild as the untaught
Indian brood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Superstition then triumphed over the minds of the
masses.&nbsp; In yon valley was the sequestered grove devoted to
obscure and horrid mysteries&mdash;altars were reared, on which
the innocent, as well as the guilty, were doomed to
bleed&mdash;the Druid priests performed the horrid murders, and
pretended that they could, by such means, foretel future events,
blasphemously asserting that the attitude in which the victim
fell, the writhing agonies of expiring life, the manner in which
the blood flowed, or the convulsions of the wounds opened, or
closed, were indications of futurity&mdash;they conducted gloomy
processions, with victims, bound with cords, for slaughter and
sacrifice, filling the air with shrieks of agony and screams of
horror&mdash;gross idolatry, savage manners, bloody rites,
funeral pile, echoing whoop&mdash;all, all were there!</p>
<blockquote><p>Wrapped in deep sleep, the ancient Britons lay,<br
/>
Hugged their vile chains, and dream&rsquo;d their age away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was Wales, and such was Britain too, before the light of
the Christian Religion shone on her coasts.&nbsp; That
heaven-born system, with its train of imperishable blessings,
took its stand amid these wild regions, and like yon sun in the
heavens, diffused her light, extended her influence, and
multiplied her bloodless conquests.&nbsp; She has organized,
humanized, civilized, moralized, and, in many instances,
evangelized the inhabitants.&nbsp; Christianity has expelled
idolatry, restored natural affection, and has conferred, and is
conferring, numerous, most substantial, and positive
blessings.&nbsp; And while she has, on the one hand, discouraged
and eradicated those vices which were the harbingers of a
nation&rsquo;s ruin, she has, on the other, implanted those
principles on which the welfare of nations depend.&nbsp; It is
true she has prepared weapons, but they are not carnal; enlisted
soldiers, but their fight is without &ldquo;confused noise of
warriors, and garments rolled in blood;&rdquo; she has erected a
standard, but it is the Cross; unfurled a banner, but its emblem
is the dove&mdash;the bond of brotherhood; and when sovereigns,
senators, and legislators, are properly influenced by the pacific
principles of the Gospel, war <a name="page45"></a><span

no more rise upon an embattled plain, nor set upon a field of
blood.</p>

<p>Contrasting the present with the past, we feel that other
times now bless our land, and that while peace and joy bound over
the mountain tops, we can with peculiar feelings give utterance
to the language of the poet:&mdash;</p>

<h3>NEW HARBOUR.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Here numerous ships security may gain<br />
From raging tempests and the blustering main.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For want of a more extensive area of shelter, and deeper
water, great destruction of shipping has occurred on the rocks
outside the Holyhead Old Harbour by vessels endeavouring to reach
the Pier; hence the necessity of an outer harbour, sufficiently
spacious to admit a man-of-war at all times.&nbsp; This necessity
had for many years been deeply impressed upon the minds of
gentlemen of talent and experience.&nbsp; The many fearful wrecks
in the bay tended to produce a conviction that no money, within a
reasonable limit, should be spared for effecting a spacious and
complete harbour.&nbsp; It is an admitted fact that the aspect of
entrance to the present harbour, together with its inefficiency
in size, have been the sole cause of most of the shipwrecks in
the bay.&nbsp; The following melancholy record will serve to shew
that it was high time some effort should be made to save life and
property.</p>
<p>Dec. 18th, 1790.&mdash;On the north point of Salt Island the
<i>Charlemont</i> packet, on her passage from Parkgate to Dublin,
was lost, when 110 souls perished, owing to the want of a
sufficient draught in the Old Harbour.</p>
<p>Feb. 5th, 1824.&mdash;The <i>John</i>, from Cork to Liverpool,
was driven on the rocks at Penrhos, in this bay&mdash;13 lives
lost.&nbsp; She came under the lee of the Light-house in the
entrance of the harbour, but, owing to its aspect, could not come
into it, consequently was blown off.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Nov.
24th, 1826.&mdash;The <i>Marquis of Wellington</i>, from
Liverpool to Buenos Ayres, drove on shore out of the Old Harbour
upon Brynglas Rocks&mdash;16 lost.&nbsp; This vessel was from 2
o&rsquo;clock, p.m., until 5 30, p.m., at the entrance of the
Harbour.&nbsp; The captain had actually written to Liverpool that
evening, and sent the letter on shore with the boatman, informing
his owner and friends of his safe arrival at Holyhead; before 12
o&rsquo;clock all had perished!</p>
<p>Jan. 14th, 1827.&mdash;The <i>Panthia</i>, N. Y. packet, bound
for Liverpool, was driven into the bay by the violence of the
gale, and in attempting to make the harbour, went on shore about
300 yards to the eastward of the South-pier-head.&nbsp; Ship
broken up.</p>
<p>April 28th, 1829.&mdash;The <i>Harlequin</i>, from Palermo to
Liverpool, drifted on the rocks at Turkey Shore, at the entrance
of the harbour, and became a total wreck.</p>
<p>April 28th, 1829.&mdash;The <i>Fame</i>, from Barbadoes to
Liverpool, drifted on the rocks at Turkey Shore, at the entrance
of the harbour, south side.</p>
<p>April 28, 1829, the &ldquo;Fitia,&rdquo; from Rotterdam to
Liverpool, drifted from the pier to Pen Manarch, Penrhos Point,
and was much damaged.&nbsp; The captain&rsquo;s wife was
drowned.&nbsp; This vessel approached so near to the north pier
that a pound weight could have been thrown on her deck;
notwithstanding owing to the aspect of the harbour, shipwreck was
the consequence.&nbsp; To this affecting catalogue a long and
fearful list might be added, shewing that a vast amount of life
and property has been lost&mdash;lost for ever.&nbsp; But
sufficient has been recorded to prove that the New Harbour, which
is now stretching out her welcome wings across the beautiful Bay
of Holyhead, was a <i>desideratum</i>.</p>
<p>Holyhead is formed by Nature to become a great trading
community.&nbsp; The bay presents a fine spacious opening, one
half sheltered by eternal rocks, and on each side of its
entrance, are brilliant lights to guide the mariner.&nbsp; It is,
moreover, centrally situated in St. George&rsquo;s Channel, in
the tract of all its trade; and presents the only station from
the Land&rsquo;s End to the Clyde, on the east side of the
channel, (except Milford,) to which vessels can approach when the
tide has considerably ebbed.&nbsp; No wonder then, that the
various commissioners appointed by Government, consisting of some
of the most eminent naval and civil engineers, should select it
as the best place on the coast for an asylum harbour, and a
packet station.</p>
<p>Several plans were proposed for the New Harbour by different
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>eminent
engineers.&nbsp; The first plan proposed was by the late noble
spirited and indefatigably enterprising, Captain H. Evans,
Holyhead Harbour Master; but it enclosed too small an area, and
too wide an entrance.&nbsp; J. Walker, Esq., C.E., to the
Admiralty, proposed a plan which was to enclose an area of 90
acres, and 3,300 feet of breakwater, and 2,500 feet of pier, at
an expense of &pound;400,000.&nbsp; Captain Beechy, R.N.,
proposed to enclose 176 acres, with 4,500 feet of breakwater, and
3,500 feet of pier, at an expense of &pound;500,000; and J. M.
Rendall, Esq., C.E., of Westminster, (the constructor of the
Docks at Birkenhead, Great Grimsby, and Leith,) proposed a
splendid design, on a very large scale, and adopted by the
Government.&nbsp; It consists of a breakwater of 5,100 feet from
Soldier&rsquo;s Point eastward, to terminate at the
Platter&rsquo;s Buoy; and a pier of 2,100 feet from <i>Ynys
Halen</i>, (Salt Island,) with its head resting on the outward
Platter, enclosing an area of 316 acres,&mdash;three quarters of
a mile long, and in seven fathoms of water,&mdash;making one of
the most splendid refuge harbours and packet stations in the
universe; the estimate cost of which is &pound;700,000.</p>
<p>The Contractors for this gigantic project are Messrs J. and C.
Rigby, London.&nbsp; G. C. Dobson, Esq., C.E., is the Resident
Engineer; G. F. Lyster, Esq., C.E., Assistant Engineer; Mr. J.
Radford, General Manager; and Mr. R. Cousins, Engineer for the
Contractors.&nbsp; The works were commenced in January, 1848; and
they have been going on since then as rapidly as it was possible
to proceed.&nbsp; Twelve months were occupied in laying down
rails to the quarries, erecting stages, and making other
necessary preparations for the works; since which, an average of
1,300 men have been employed on the works.&nbsp; The broad gauge
has been used for the railway, by which means the contractors,
are enabled to bring larger pieces of stone than the narrow gauge
could accommodate.&nbsp; There are two quarries used, one called
Moelfry Quarry, from which limestone is produced, and the other
is, in fact, the Holyhead Mountain, from the sides of which the
materials for the works are taken.&nbsp; A railway is formed from
the extensive quarry on the side of the mountain to the
Soldier&rsquo;s Point, and Salt Island.&nbsp; Wooden staging is
run out into the sea; strong long balks or piles are fixed in a
vertical position in the water, resting on the base; these are
secured with beams placed longitudinally so as to form a base for
the construction of the railway.&nbsp; The top of the staging is
considerably above high-water mark.&nbsp; The depth of the sea at
low water, on the <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>line of the breakwater, varies from 20 to 40 feet; the
tide rising, on an average, to a further height of 17 feet in
spring, and 7 feet in neaps.&nbsp; Along the top of the staging
are railways capable of sustaining the weight of a locomotive
engine and a number of waggons loaded.&nbsp; In the erection of
these stages the utmost care has been evinced by the contractors
and engineers to prevent accident; in order to obtain this
object, no expense has been spared; the machinery and staging
being of the best and strongest description.&nbsp; The work may
be described as consisting of two breakwaters, one to the north,
(Soldier&rsquo;s Point,) and the other to east, (Salt
Island.)&nbsp; The quarries are contiguous to the works, and here
a great number of the workmen are employed; they are, perhaps,
the most extensive in the country, and it is not an hypothesis to
say that in no quarries extant is work of such magnitude and
rapidity carried on.&nbsp; Holyhead Mountain, which affords the
source of supply, consists of schistus quartz of so hard a nature
that the tools of the workmen will scarcely touch it, and its
edges will cut glass.&nbsp; The quarrying begun with the foot of
the mountain slope, and it has progressed into the mountain until
an elevation of 130 feet perpendicular has been attained.&nbsp;
The scene at the quarries exhibits one of the most active
pictures of industry, from the width of the workings, and the
number of labourers employed.</p>
<p>The huge mountain, towering from 700 to 800 feet above the
level of the sea, expanding its full breast, and showing its fine
broad forehead, and which, comparatively speaking, had slumbered
for centuries, is at length disturbed from its long repose, by
&ldquo;physical force.&rdquo;&nbsp; A visit to this scene of
industry, which literally swarms with men and horses, is no small
treat.&nbsp; Tramways are laid in every direction, along which
waggons roll to the point where they are required.&nbsp;
Locomotive engines of unique design and requirements are
continually at work, pouring their dense smoke into the air,
passing along with amazing velocity to the terminus of the
stage,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Quick moves the balanced beam, of giant birth,<br
/>
Wields his large limbs, and nodding shakes the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The clang of the hammer of the blacksmith&mdash;the whirl of
the wheel of the grinding mill&mdash;the jerking of the punching
machine, perforating thick sheet iron, as easily as a lady would
put her <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>needle through pasteboard&mdash;the buz in the
engineers&rsquo; compartment&mdash;the pendulum-like tick, tick,
tick, of the strikers pursuing their monotonous
vocations&mdash;the enormous cranes, with their pullies, hooks,
and ponderous weights attached, demonstrating the laws of
gravitation&mdash;the miners, deep buried in the bowels of the
mountain, the sound of whose strokes, forcibly reminds one of the
fairies of by-gone days&mdash;the signal-flags floating in the
breeze, and announcing in telegraphic language, &ldquo;to all
whom it may concern,&rdquo; that it is high time to take care of
&ldquo;number one&rdquo;&mdash;the blasting, which is on a most
magnificent scale, report after report, making one almost feel as
if we were in the vicinity of an embattled plain, and last,
though not least, the strong, sleek, well-fed horses, prancing in
their furbished harness&mdash;all, all are before you and around
you.&nbsp; Nor are the workmen less striking and
peculiar&mdash;the ease with which the most unwieldy hammers are
heaved by them attest their prodigious strength and profound
skill&mdash;some may be seen, high in the quarry, suspended by
ropes, reminding one of the bye-gone practice of egg-taking from
the high cliffs of the promontory, pushing down the rocks,
loosened by the terrible blasting, shouting to each other as if
they gloried in their elevated position&mdash;the engine drivers
guiding their iron horses along the stages, while the sea roars
60 feet beneath them, meeting each other on the up and down
lines, with all the pleasantry of stage-coach men of olden time;
fear is not in their vocabulary; though the yawning gulf is
beneath them, they sing, and smile, and whistle, as they sweep
along the trembling stage, as if seated in their respective
cottages, with their playful wives beside them, and their merry
children round them.</p>
<p>But to return&mdash;to cut into so hard a rock the contractors
have to adopt the process of blasting, which is carried on upon a
magnitude which has never been equalled.&nbsp; To penetrate the
rocks sets of workmen, in twos, are employed in different parts
of the face of the mountain, and these men drive a heading or
gallery into the solid rock, about five feet high and three wide,
for a distance of 30 to 40 feet, which is accomplished chiefly by
blasting.&nbsp; In the extremity of this gallery, which runs
first horizontally, and is then sunk perpendicularly, the powder
is placed in a wood-case or bag, and the hole being tamped or
filled up with clay, it is fired by the galvanic battery.&nbsp;
The charges vary from one to five tons of gunpowder, according to
the face of the rock to be acted upon; and the quantities thrown
down varies from six to thirty thousand tons in an
explosion.&nbsp; One of these &ldquo;headings&rdquo; or <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&ldquo;shots&rdquo; as they are called, went off this
day (Dec. 7, 1852).&nbsp; Sir Richard Bulkeley, Bart., the Rev.
J. Williams, M. Errington Stanley, Esq., and G. F. Lyster, Esq.,
were present on the occasion, and took their station on a bridge
to witness the &ldquo;shot;&rdquo; but on seeing the stones roll
through the air, they deemed it prudent to act upon the well
known maxim, &ldquo;retreat is the better part of valour,&rdquo;
and instantly left their elevated position, and placed themselves
beneath the abutment of the bridge.&nbsp; The writer, who was
present, was a little amused to see such a fine illustration of
the first law of nature&mdash;<span class="smcap">Self
Preservation</span>.&nbsp; As a proof of the fearful extent of
these explosions, I would just observe, that although the bridge
on which the aforesaid gentlemen stood was about 800 yards from
the quarry, a stone fell within a few yards of it.&nbsp; The
effect of these blastings on the rock are sometimes of a curious
character, but generally speaking the rock when thrown down
leaves the surface of the cliff smooth and perpendicular.&nbsp;
The stones thrown out are generally large, many of them weighing
twenty tons.&nbsp; Shafts are also sunk from 30 to 40 feet
deep.&nbsp; The quantity of stone taken from the quarries is
accurately weighed, and already about two million tons have been
buried in the sea.&nbsp; During the past year the average deposit
has amounted to 3,500 tons per day, and supposing that there have
been 250 full working days, this would give a deposit for the
year of 875,000 tons.</p>
<p>The mode of operation is as follows.&nbsp; The rough
breakwater is formed by rubble-stones, brought from the mountain
in waggons peculiarly constructed for the express purpose (the
design of which, I understand, was furnished by the resident
engineer, and proves the versatility of his genius), and dropped
perpendicularly through the staging into the sea, and is then
left to be dealt with by the sea, which arranges the deposit in a
manner best suited to form a consolidated mass; and it is
calculated that, when a sufficient portion of the mountain has
been dropped into the sea, there will be formed a breakwater
which will have an average base of from 400 to 500 feet, and this
will gradually slope upwards to about 50 feet on the summit of
the breakwater on which the stone pier will be built.&nbsp; But
after all the sea is the great workman.&nbsp; We find the
materials, and it makes the foundation; or as the celebrated
French engineer, Monsieur Cachin, observes, &ldquo;If man be
strong enough to heap together rocks in the midst of the ocean,
the action of the sea alone can dispose them in the manner most
likely to ensure their stability.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>This is now
most effectually carried out by this new means of depositing
stones.&nbsp; When a heavy sea comes on, it breaks over the
ridges of rubble-rocks, which are interspersed amongst the timber
of the staging, and gradually lowers them, carrying away ridge
after ridge, until that which was far above the water is
completely submerged; and the sea acting upon these stones
gradually solidifies the mass, which binds itself into the clayey
bottom of the harbour, and the whole becomes tenaciously cemented
to the ground.&nbsp; And this process will go on until the
deposit shall have formed a place sufficiently inclined to
sustain the breaking of the sea without removal.</p>
<p>The slopes, it is understood, will be faced with dressed stone
to a certain extent, similar to the fine specimen of beautiful
workmanship, which has been executed for about 100 yards, at the
seaward side of &ldquo;Soldier&rsquo;s Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present effective staff consists of eight locomotive
engines, running on five lines of railway on the breakwater; a
fixed engine for grinding, fifty horses, and 1,300 men; and the
stores embrace all things requisite for conducting the work in a
self-supporting manner.&nbsp; This mass of mind and matter is
able every day to accomplish a removal into the sea of 4,000 tons
weight of the mountain, and so the work proceeds.</p>
<p>The works are being carried on by the spirited contractors
with the utmost expedition compatible with good
workmanship.&nbsp; The present extent of the north breakwater is
3,700 feet, which leaves about 1,400 feet to be
constructed.&nbsp; The east pier extends 1,000 feet, which is
about half its intended length. <a name="citation51"></a><a
href="#footnote51" class="citation">[51]</a>&nbsp; Attention has
also been directed to the permanent wall of the great breakwater
on the harbour side, with a view to find quay accommodation for
vessels to discharge, and for steamers to take in coals.&nbsp;
About 800 feet of this walling is now being levelled for the
quay, on which cranes, &amp;c., are to be placed immediately, and
a connection may ultimately be made with the railway.</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>When
the work will be ended is a wide question.&nbsp; It is said the
Contractors are under an engagement to finish their work by the
close of 1855.&nbsp; The works are certainly progressing
satisfactorily, and on the part of the Contractors there is a
desire to urge them forward as rapidly as it is possible to
proceed.&nbsp; It is a work which all desire to see accomplished
and in use at as early a moment as the works can be safely and
scientifically completed.</p>
<p>The public mind exults in these vast undertakings, &ldquo;vain
man would&rdquo; now-a-days not only &ldquo;be wise,&rdquo; but
he would be <i>powerful</i>, and he delights, not merely in
soliciting the aid of Nature, but in &ldquo;attacking&rdquo;
it.&nbsp; When the whole undertaking is completed, protected by
batteries, and ornamented with light-houses, observatories, and
telegraphs, and adorned with promenades, and a Sailors&rsquo;
Chapel, it will present a very interesting illustration of the
success with which intellect and perseverance and enterprise have
been crowned; and will be indicative not only of the wealth of
the nation, but a proof of the mental over the physical world,
worthy of Britain in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The words of the immortal Shakespeare, put into the mouth of
one of his heroines, may, with a slight alteration, be applied to
the New Harbour:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash; This same blessed (Milford) Holyhead, and,
by the way<br />
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To inherit such a haven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For certain purposes, such as shelter, the harbour will become
progressively available.&nbsp; Great benefit has been derived
from the works, even in their present imperfect state.&nbsp;
Hundreds of vessels have already taken shelter under the
breakwater; the writer has counted as many as forty vessels at
one time anchored in the Harbour; and the time is not far
distant, when the spacious and beautiful haven will afford a
refuge to ships of all sizes.&nbsp; When the foaming surges rave,
and the billows roar&mdash;when the storm-cloud broods, and the
thunder-storms crash&mdash;when hurricane howls music, on the
wild wide sea, and the big waves roll the chorus; when the
shattered vessel is driven the mock of ocean, and the sport of
winds, her tars will anchor here, and, safely moored, will tell
their wonders over.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe
from the wind and tide<br />
The mighty vessels will triumphant ride.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The works may be seen by visitors, subject to certain
regulations, <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

the works, in the obtaining of which there is no difficulty.</p>
<h3>CHESTER AND HOLYHEAD RAILWAY.</h3>
<p>Railways have given an impetus to our country&rsquo;s
civilization.&nbsp; They are the veins and arteries by means of
which the circulation of the social body is carried on.&nbsp;
Remote places are, by this means, virtually brought near to each
other; and thus, while intelligence is diffused, an impulse is
given to commerce, each of which advantages most powerfully
affects the conditions of the people.&nbsp; The benefits of cheap
and quick communication to a great commercial state are too
evident to require to be enlarged upon.&nbsp; Time and money are
thus importantly saved, and a rapid and economical transit of
goods, by lessening their costs, enable the humblest to partake
of comforts which were formerly considered as luxuries only for
the rich.</p>
<p>Amongst the railway enterprises in this kingdom, the Chester
and Holyhead line must be considered as possessing peculiar
claims to public attention.&nbsp; The stupendous character of the
work&mdash;the difficulties which had to be overcome, and the
vast sum invested in the undertaking, place this line in the
foremost rank amongst the splendid achievements of our days;
indeed we may justly consider it the masterpiece of the human
intellect, and the wonder of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; In its
course, it divides broad estuaries, it penetrates the bowels of
the loftiest hills, forming an iron-road where the foot of man
had never trod, and the hardiest rocks have succumbed to the
irresistible energy of human actions and scientific
skill&mdash;it crosses the important navigable river at Conway,
and the Menai Straits, by means of immense iron-tubes, at such an
elevation as not to impede the progress of the largest
vessels.&nbsp; It presents an extraordinary display of enterprise
and wealth; so large an accumulation of the conquests of energy,
and the constituent elements of riches, it may be safely said,
was never before collected in the same compass.&nbsp; The whole
line is a noble exemplification of art subjugating and triumphing
over the opposition of natural difficulties.&nbsp; Its completion
formed an epoch in the history and application of mechanical
power.&nbsp; If only a few years ago it had been said that people
could pass over the Menai Straits, without inconvenience and
without danger, at the rate of from 30 to 40 miles per hour, <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>the tale
would have been treated as one of those visionary stories, which
in former days were the amusements of the nursery.</p>
<p>Holyhead is the terminus of this extraordinary line&mdash;a
line of great value to this place, effecting as it has done a
rapid communication between this port and the eastern part of the
county, as well as the manufacturing districts of Cheshire,
Lancashire, and the North; while, uniting with other lines, a
connexion is opened up with the Metropolis.</p>
<h3>RAILWAY STATION.</h3>
<p>The Holyhead Station is an extensive and commodious one,
connected with which are Refreshment Rooms, with Waiting and
Dressing Rooms attached, Telegraph Office and a well furnished
Book Room, the whole fitted up on a most splendid scale, well
arranged and in excellent order, and plentifully supplied with
luxurious food.&nbsp; A table d&rsquo;hote at the Refreshment
Rooms on the arrival of the mail and express packets from
Ireland, conducted by Mrs. Hibbert, late of Wolverton.&nbsp; In
Mr. Massinberd, manager of the Railway Station, the traveller
will meet with a gentleman anxious to give every information
which even the most timorous and querulous may require to further
his views, or quell his fears.&nbsp; The Railway Company have
also erected a large cattle and luggage station on the
pier.&nbsp; A new line of railroad has been constructed along the
margin of the <i>traeth</i>, or sandy estuary, which forms the
Harbour, extending nearly a mile from the Station to the
Pier.&nbsp; Arrangements for the transit of goods and live stock
between Ireland and England have been made.&nbsp; A steamer
leaves the North Wall, Dublin, every evening; but the period has
been so short that no opportunity has been afforded to ascertain
its success; there is, however, every prospect of the traffic
becoming a very important feature in the developement of this
line, and certain to be productive of a large additional revenue
to the company.</p>
<p>There are many distinguished men in the railway world, who
have been accustomed for many years to look <i>afore</i> and
<i>aft</i>, who do not despair of seeing the Chester and Holyhead
one of the most profitable, as it is one of the best officered,
lines of railway in the kingdom; but we think that the government
should take upon itself to cover the vast outlay which it caused
in the erection of that wonder of the world, the Britannia
Tubular Bridge&mdash;a <span class="GutSmall">NATIONAL
CONVENIENCE</span>.</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>It has
been a cause of regret to thousands that the proposals for the
erection of the Hotel in Britannia Park, the grounds of which are
in rapid progress towards completion, have not been taken up with
that warmth and spirit, which the zeal and penetration of S. M.
Peto, Esq., M.P., Chairman of the Chester and Holyhead Railway
Company, led him to consider desirable.&nbsp; It is to be hoped,
however, that the vast expenditure already incurred will not be
thrown away, and the property suffered again to become almost a
waste, affording as it does the most beautiful prospects, and the
most healthy and convenient positions in the neighbourhood, to
which multitudes of wealthy families, carrying on business in the
crowded cities of England, would be glad to retire, could
sufficient accommodation be secured to them.&nbsp; In conclusion,
we would respectfully urge upon the shareholders not to sacrifice
their interests in an undertaking whose prospects are of a most
cheering character, in parting with their shares at present
prices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Holyhead</span> derives its chief
prosperity and consequence from being the Station of the
Government Packets, which convey the London and other English
mails to and from Ireland, to which it lies exactly opposite, and
is the shortest and safest passage across St. George&rsquo;s
Channel; and now that the Railway is completed through to
Chester, a new interest is awakened, and hopes entertained that
the port will become one of the first importance to this remote
peninsular of the kingdom.&nbsp; In addition to Her
Majesty&rsquo;s packets, there are regular steam vessels, in
connection with the Railway Company, that sail from the harbour
daily.&nbsp; These are splendid first class and fast sailing
steam-ships; the fittings-up are of superior character, excellent
tables are kept, <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>stewards and stewardesses are most attentive, the crew
are steady, sober, and experienced sailors, the commanders are
true seamen, assiduous in the discharge of their highly
responsible and arduous professional duties, civil and easy in
address, intelligent in conversation, and most desirous to
secure, by the best attention, the comfort and convenience of
their passengers&mdash;these form an aggregate of all possible
auxiliaries to the enjoyment of a swift and pleasant run of
4&frac12; hours, which lands you on the Irish shores.&nbsp; These
superb steamers dart boldly forward, like some ocean bird upon
its wing, on their trip across the channel.&nbsp; There is
something almost startling in looking intensely on that strange
unconscious power which produces results of living motion, with a
beauty, majesty, and rapidity of action, without any approach to
violence or hurry; it is at such moments that the light of modern
science appears almost too dazzling to the human eye.&nbsp; It is
said that between Holyhead and Dublin no packet has been lost
since the days of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; In 1652, a weekly postal
communication was established between Dublin and England, by
packet to Holyhead.</p>

<h3>HOTELS.</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;Royal Hotel&rdquo; is conducted by Mr. and Mrs.
Hibbert, and the &ldquo;Castle Hotel&rdquo; by Mr. and Mrs. Mc
Vittie.&nbsp; At these <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>hotels there is every comfort and
convenience, whether for the invalid in hopes of renovated
health, or the tourist delighting in creature comforts.&nbsp;
They are replete with every requisite for the accommodation of
visitors, and afford every inducement to persons desirous, by
quietness, to enjoy a relaxation from the cares of business and
the bustle of populous districts.&nbsp; Cleanliness, prompt
attention, combined with moderate charges, are the
characteristics of these establishments, and render them pleasant
places for a short stay.</p>
<p>The Royal Hotel, which is contiguous to the Station, has
undergone thorough alteration, and every care has been taken to
adopt all modern improvements, with a view of securing to
travellers and families every accommodation which a first-class
hotel can afford.&nbsp; It is fitted up in a style of elegance
which renders it one of the most complete establishments of the
kind in the kingdom, and in every way suited for visitors of the
highest grade of society; it is fit to accommodate Royalty
itself, and we opine the day is not far distant when it will be
honoured with such illustrious guests.&nbsp; It is presided over
by Mrs. Hibbert, late of Wolverton Station, whose unwearied
exertions are employed to secure her inmates, as far as possible,
all that can be desired.&nbsp; Here are hot, cold, and shower
baths; carriages, cars, post-horses, &amp;c.&nbsp; Omnibuses to
and from the Railway Station and Steam-packets, for the
convenience of parties frequenting this hotel, <i>gratis</i>.</p>
<h3>TRIPS BY SEA.</h3>
<p>Many persons resort to aquatic excursions for health,
recreation, and the gratification of a poetic taste; and we are
happy to say that there are few places that afford better
opportunities for trips by sea than Holyhead.&nbsp; Should the
visitor desire a short voyage, he may be gratified; three or four
miles will land him at <i>Trefadog</i> (Madog&rsquo;s House), or
<i>Penrhyn</i> (The Cape), on the opposite shore.&nbsp; Or he may
have a nine miles sail to the Skerries, or Island of Seals, and
thus give the good man of the rocks a proof that the sons of the
soil cast a wishful look towards his solitary abode by day, as
well as the sons of the ocean by night.&nbsp; Or he may have a
four miles cruise to South Stack, glide by the New Harbour, and
gaze upon the sublime grandeur of the bold promontory.&nbsp; (See
page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page45">45</a></span>.)&nbsp; Should the tourist, however,
wish to achieve such nautical wonders as to lose sight of his own
dear land, and to be able to say to his friends on
returning&mdash;&ldquo;I have <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>crossed the seas!&rdquo; his wish may
be fully realized.&nbsp; Walk to the Pier, tread the deck of one
of our splendid steamers, and in 4&frac12; hours you will be
landed on the shores of Ireland, and inhale the bracing air of
the far-famed Emerald Isle.</p>
<h3>PENRHOS PARK.</h3>
<p>This handsome mansion (about two miles from Holyhead) is
embosomed in the wood, and is the residence of the Hon. Wm. Owen
Stanley, M.P. for the city of Chester.&nbsp; The principal
entrance faces the sea, of which it commands a very extensive
view.&nbsp; About a quarter of a mile east of Penrhos is Penrhyn,
a cliff projecting into the sea, which has been the residence of
the family of Owen for many centuries, who were descended from
one of the five sons of Hwfa ap Cynddelw, Lord of Llifon in 1157,
now represented by Lord Edisbury and the Hon. W. O. Stanley, sons
of the late Lord Stanley, of Alderley.&nbsp; Hwfa was
contemporary with Owen Gwynedd, one of the most celebrated
princes of North Wales, who on more than one occasion gave battle
and completely routed the English army, under the personal
command of Henry II.&nbsp; Hwfa founded one of the fifteen royal
tribes of Wales; and his five sons inherited his princely
property, extending from Aberffraw to Holyhead, and including a
great part of the Island of Anglesey.</p>
<h3>LADY STANLEY&rsquo;S HOSPITALITY TO SHIPWRECKED SAILORS.</h3>
<p>During the tremendous gales from the north, in January and
February, 1802, the <i>Die Liebe</i>, a Dutch galliot, bound from
Rotterdam to Ireland, and the <i>Brothers</i>, of Liverpool, were
wrecked near Penrhos, the first at midnight, where the
unfortunate sufferers found all the comfort and attention which
beneficence, united to influence, can so happily bestow, under
the hospitable roof of the late Lady Stanley.</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Llwyd, in his &ldquo;Lines addressed to the
Thrush, in the Garden at Penrhos,&rdquo; alludes to this
melancholy catastrophe,</p>
<blockquote><p>A happier day, dear chorister, is thine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A grave unhaunted by the tread of fear;<br />
A little forest, free from kites and crime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When music only meets thy listening ear,&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Save

<h3>ST. BRIDE&rsquo;S, OR TOWYN CHAPEL; AND THE ANCIENT
TUMULUS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here
friends and foes<br />
Lie close, unmindful of their former feuds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name of <i>barrows</i> is given to the artificial hills
which were in ancient times very generally constructed to
commemorate the mighty dead.&nbsp; Such hills are usually formed
of earth, but sometimes of heaped stones.&nbsp; In the latter
form, they are almost exclusively confined to Scotland, and are
there called <i>cairns</i>.&nbsp; Barrows are found in almost
every country, from America to the steppes of Tartary, and
probably exhibit the earliest, and assuredly the grandest species
of honorary burial; a humble relic of which we still retain in
the mounds of earth over the graves of our churchyards.&nbsp;
Assuming that the barrow indicates, in the matter of sepulture,
the first step of man from the merely savage state, it does not
seem to have been forsaken for monuments of greater art and
delicacy until such further advances in civilization had been
made as might be indicated to a careful inquirer by the
alteration in the form or structure of the <i>tumulus</i> itself,
and still more by the contents which might be disinterred; for it
was in all, except perhaps the very earliest instances, customary
to bury with the dead their weapons, their ornaments, and other
articles of value.&nbsp; In the barrows of the earliest period we
might expect to find no more than the bones of the uncoffined and
unurned barbarian with his arrow heads of flint; while those of a
later period would furnish stone and earthen coffins, urns of <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>metal and
earthenware, spears, swords, shields, bracelets, beads, mirrors,
combs, and even coins and cloths,&mdash;articles which are
actually found in some <i>tumuli</i>, and most of them in those
of this country.</p>
<p>The cairns, or carnedd, heaps of stones, are frequently
mentioned in Scripture, and in every instance, when not
accompanied with a pillar, we find them raised with the same
object, namely, to cover the remains of those who died in crime,
and whose memories it was intended to dishonour.&nbsp; Such were
the heaps of stones raised over the remains of Achan, Absalom,
and the King of Ai.&nbsp; Joshua vii. 25, 26&mdash;viii.
25.&nbsp; 2 Sam. xviii. 17&nbsp; In Syria and Palestine it is
still usual for one who passes such a heap to throw a stone on
it, in order to express his detestation of the infamy
commemorated, as well as to contribute to the maintenance or
increase the size of the monument.&nbsp; In Scotland, too, in
some parts, it was formerly, and perhaps still is common for a
person to say to the offender, &ldquo;Never mind, I shall throw a
stone over your cairn yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are numerous cairns in Wales, many of which still bear
distinctive names, such as <i>Carn Vadryn</i> and <i>Carn
Hendwll</i>.&nbsp; Allusion to these is made in the works of the
earliest bards; for instance, Taliesin observes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Carawg will purchase<br />
Wales abounding with <i>canerddau</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is said that in Druidic times the cairn was a species of
monument awarded only to persons of distinction.&nbsp; The
following passage on the subject occurs in the life of Gruffydd
ab Cynan:&mdash;&ldquo;Now the mountain on which the battle was
fought, is called by the people of the country the <i>carn</i>
mountain, that is to say, the mountain of the <i>carnedd</i>; for
in that place there is an immense <i>carnedd</i> of stones, under
which was buried a <i>champion</i> in primitive ages of
antiquity.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cairn was of gradual growth, inasmuch
as it was the custom for every passer by to fling an additional
stone upon the common heap, out of reverence to the memory of the
person who was interred underneath.</p>
<p>We are told however that when the practice of burying in
churchyards became general, the cairn was condemned as fit only
for great criminals.&nbsp; Hence the expression, &ldquo;<i>carn
or dy wyneb</i>&rdquo; (may a cairn be upon thy face), when one
wishes ill to another man.&nbsp; In this case travellers cast
their stones out of detestation.&nbsp; <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Owing, therefore, to such a change of
popular feeling in regard to the cairn, it would now be
impossible, from its mere outward appearance, to conjecture the
character of the person whom it covers.&nbsp; Moreover, the size
would vary, not only according to the honour or disgrace with
which the deceased was in his lifetime regarded, but also
according to the situation of the grave itself, whether it was
near a public road or not.&nbsp; It may be, however, that the
position of the body, or form of the <i>cistvaen</i> (stone
chest), or some other interior arrangement, would prove a clue to
the solution of this question.</p>
<p>Many of the cairns in this country have been opened, and
generally found to contain undoubted evidence of human interment;
and where this was not the case, their absence may be very
reasonably accounted for by the supposition that the body was
burned (as in the case of Achan), and the stones heaped over the
ashes.</p>
<p>Upwards of one hundred years ago, Sir Nicholas Bailey opened a
<i>carnedd</i> at Plas Newydd, Anglesey.&nbsp; Supposing the
mound a mere heap of rubbish, he began to level it; but when the
workmen had opened the entrance into the large ruin, he ordered
them to discontinue their operations, as it seemed to contain
nothing but bones.</p>
<p>The mound or tumulus on which the remains of <i>Capel y
Towyn</i> (see page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page6">6</a></span>) stand, is evidently the cemetery of a
vast number of persons.&nbsp; Some years ago, a coffin was
discovered containing a skull, and the other principal bones of
the human frame, quite perfect.&nbsp; Four or five other coffins
were also found, all of which contained bones, in a good state of
preservation.&nbsp; The coffins were constructed of rough stones,
having sides, ends, lids, but no bottoms.&nbsp; The dates of
these burials are not correctly determined, but they are of
considerable antiquity.</p>
<p>A very interesting paper relative to this place, written by
the Hon. W. O. Stanley, M.P. for the city of Chester, was read at
the Arch&aelig;ological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland,
in August, 1846, from which we make the following
extract:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This ancient chapel is on the old London
road, about two and a half miles from Holyhead, situated close to
the sea.&nbsp; Here is a great mound, about 30 feet in height,
being 750 in circumference at the base.&nbsp; On the summit of
this mound are seen the foundation walls of a small chapel, which
has given the name <i>Towyn y Capel</i> (the Bay of the Chapel)
to the beautiful inlet upon the shore.&nbsp; This mound is
composed of sea sand, and contains <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>a great number of graves, arranged in
four or five tiers, one above another, at intervals of about
three or four feet.&nbsp; The bodies were laid invariably with
the feet converging towards the centre of the mound, the head
being towards the outer side.&nbsp; It appears that no similar
instance of interment in graves formed indiscriminately, as it
regards the point of the compass towards which the feet of the
corpse were laid, has yet been noticed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>CROMLECHS, OR DRUIDICAL ALTARS.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Who raised the wondrous pile?&nbsp; I asked and
sighed,<br />
And paused for a reply; but none replied.<br />
Time passed me by, and answered with a frown,<br />
Whoever raised it I will pull it down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is perhaps no subject on which antiquarians have more
employed their learning and industry, on which their theories
have been so fruitful, or their discussions so endless, as on the
origin and history of those ancient stones generally denominated
Druidical.&nbsp; But, who were the founders&mdash;when were they
founded&mdash;and what was the immediate object of their
foundation, are questions which at this period we cannot fully
answer.&nbsp; At the same time the undoubted antiquity of these
remains, the tolerably accurate glimpses of their original
condition which the antiquarian writers afford us, and the very
mystery in which they are enveloped, altogether make their study
peculiarly attractive.&nbsp; But more than all this, there is one
fact connected with these antique monuments, which renders them
of very high interest indeed, and that is, their dispersion over
every part of the world, bearing evidently a common impress of
the ideas and habits of their founders, even in places so remote
from each other as to make it appear impossible that there should
have been any mutual intercourse in those ancient times.&nbsp;
Monuments of large and rude stones, disposed in the forms known
respectively in our country by the names of circles, cromlechs,
kistvaens, and stones erect, are found extensively dispersed
through Great Britain, Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, Denmark,
Sweden, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Malta, Gaza,
Ph&oelig;nicia, Malabar, Bombay, and other parts of India,
Palestine, Persia, Northern Africa, North America, and in the
Islands of the Indian Archipelago, and of the South Sea.&nbsp;
What conclusions then can we draw from these phenomena, but that
those common ideas and habits of which we have <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>spoken must
have existed prior to the dispersion of the great family of man,
of which the Scriptures tell us?&nbsp; If the identity of the
monuments known as Druidical in this country with those existing
in Palestine and other parts mentioned in the sacred writings be
acknowledged, this important result follows:&mdash;that whilst,
on the one hand, &ldquo;the form of existing monuments
illustrates the form of those mentioned in Scripture;&rdquo; on
the other, &ldquo;the uses of those described in Scripture
illustrates the uses of those now existing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Sacred Scriptures furnish us with many indications as to the use
of the altar and circle of stones.&nbsp; (Gen. xx. 24, 25, Josh.
v. 5&ndash;7, 1 Sam. vii. 16, 17&ndash;x. 8.)</p>
<p>The general opinion is that the cromlechs were altars on which
the priests offered their dreadful sacrifices.&nbsp; On this
subject C&aelig;sar has the following remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;The
whole nation of the Gauls, (whom C&aelig;sar describes as
imitators of those of Britain, and as deriving from the latter
their customs) is much addicted to religious observances, and on
that account, those who are attacked by any of the more serious
diseases, and who are in danger of warfare, either offer human
sacrifice or make a vow that they will offer them, and they
employ the Druids to officiate at their sacrifices; for they
consider that the favour of the immortal gods cannot be
conciliated, unless the life of one man be offered up for that of
another; they have sacrifices of the same kind appointed on
behalf of the state.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which we may add, that
Tacitus, in his account of the Roman attack on the Isle of
Anglesey, the then great stronghold of the British Druids,
states&mdash;that &ldquo;they held it right to smear their altars
with the blood of their captives.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a striking
corroboration of the theory that the cromlechs were the altars on
which these dreadful sacrifices were performed, to find that in
this very Isle of Anglesey are yet existing about thirty, among
which are some of the largest and most magnificent our country
possesses.&nbsp; It is well known that, at a very early period,
this Island was the great school of Druidism&mdash;the chosen
retreat and asylum of the Druidical Priests.&nbsp; No wonder,
therefore, that travellers are particularly struck with the great
absence of trees, having naturally enough supposed that the
former scene of Druidical superstition, the horrors of which were
carried on in the dark recesses of consecrated groves, would not
be so bare and destitute of timber.&nbsp; Nor did Anglesey always
wear this naked appearance.&nbsp; Classical authors tell us it
formerly had its venerable woods and shady groves, and the
ancient British appellation <i>Ynys Dywyll</i>, or the <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Shady Island,
intimates the same fact; and bodies of trees are constantly met
with in the pits from which the inhabitants get their peat.</p>
<p>Having made these remarks we shall now direct the attention of
the tourist to the</p>
<h3>TREFIGNETH CROMLECHI.</h3>
<p>About a mile and a half from Holyhead, at Trefigneth (a house
on the quagmire) farm, may be seen some relics of Druidical
superstition, and remarkable monuments of the rude art of the
Ancient Britons.&nbsp; They are what antiquarians call
<i>cromlechi</i>.&nbsp; Two derivations have been given for the
word cromlech: the one, &ldquo;an inclining stone,&rdquo; from
the British word <i>crwm</i>, bowed, and <i>llech</i>, a broad,
flat stone; and the other, &ldquo;a devoted stone or
altar,&rdquo; from the Hebrew
<i>c&oelig;r&oelig;m-luach</i>,&mdash;the first part expressing
the appearance of the upper or principal stone of the cromlech;
the second, the horrible use to which, there is good reason to
believe, it was put.&nbsp; The stones referred to are called by
the Welsh, at this time, <i>Llechen Trevigneth</i>, i.e.,
Trevigneth flat stones; and the field they are in, <i>Cae&rsquo;r
Llechen</i>, flat stone field.</p>
<p>The writer visited these cromlechs on the 18th of February,
1853, and, assisted by a friend, measured some of the huge,
unshapely stones.&nbsp; The western cromlech consists of 5
stones, four of which were undoubtedly uprights, but have fallen
from their proper situation, and the table stone, with its flat
face, reposes upon them.&nbsp; This superincumbent stone measures
12 feet long, including the piece broken off at the eastern
end&mdash;it is 6 feet wide, and in some parts about 2 feet in
diameter.&nbsp; One of the four stones is 10 feet long, by 4
wide, and about 10 feet in circumference.&nbsp; At the western
end of this cromlech are three stones, but for what purpose they
were originally used, I wot not.</p>
<p>The eastern cromlech consists of 8 stones, two of which are
standing; one perpendicularly, the other in an oblique
position&mdash;following the example of its companions, which
have long since bowed beneath the weight or pressure of
centuries;&mdash;these are 6 feet long, one of which is about 10
feet in circumference, the other 8.&nbsp; There is one reposing
longitudinally, measuring 10 feet long, and 6 feet in
circumference.&nbsp; The other three are of smaller
dimensions.&nbsp; There are two table or superincumbent stones,
one of which measures 10 feet long, by 6 wide; the other, <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>6 feet long,
by 5 wide.&nbsp; When first constructed, this cromlech would have
admitted a tall man to stand upright in it.</p>
<p>When I first approached these ruins, I felt that I was
treading the sacred ground of ancient Britons; a longing to
comprehend their origin came over me&mdash;a yearning to make out
the dark enigma that for ages had puzzled the learned and the
wise.&nbsp; While walking round these ancient relics, I felt
somewhat astonished and bewildered.&nbsp; Awe, amazement, and
solemnity, were as a load on my spirit, pressing heavily.&nbsp; I
wished to know, but I was ignorant; I wished to admire, but I was
awestruck.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ages seem present; shadowy, giant forms,<br />
And fantasies that throng the heated brain,<br />
Are fluttering to and fro; unhallowed rites,<br />
Obscene and cruel, and unearthly shapes,<br />
Start into being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many remains have I gazed on with solemn feelings; but never
do I remember such arresting, mysterious solemnity being excited
within me by mouldering castle, abbey, church, or priory, as that
which then oppressed me.&nbsp; It is strange, but these stones
seem embued with the spirit of by-gone ages.&nbsp; There they
are, monuments of antiquity&mdash;huge, grand, wonderful,
incomprehensible!&nbsp; They over-awe you as they stand, gloomily
questioning, as it were, your right to approach so near their
sacred enclosure.</p>
<p>With these relics we cannot but associate the Druidical
priests, who were the principal actors on all public
occasions.&nbsp; The finger of time has long ceased to keep a
calendar of their moments, or of their actions, and their dust
has for ages mingled with the clods of the valley!&nbsp; Yet,
here they once performed their idolatrous worship, and were held
in great veneration by the people.&nbsp; Imagination takes the
place of memory, and, influenced by the appalling gloom that
pervades the spot, conjures up shapes of human victims reeking in
sacrifice, while Druidic priests in their long white garments,
the tiara, or sacred crown, their temples enwreathed with
chaplets of oak-leaves, the magic wand in their hand, and on
their heads a serpent&rsquo;s egg, as an ensign of their order,
and thus attired we see them going forth to sacrifice, sullen,
cruel, implacable, standing round the crimson-stained altar,
shrouded with superstition, mystery, and death.</p>
<p>The durability or antiquity of these extraordinary relics is
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>calculated
to excite emotions of astonishment and awe in the
mind:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>These ancient stones, o&rsquo;ergrown with bearded
moss,<br />
And by the melancholy skill of time<br />
Moulded to beauty, charms the bosom more<br />
Than the palaces of princes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They must have weathered out more than 2000 years.&nbsp; It
was about <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 60, and during the
reign of Nero, the Roman Emperor, when <i>Suetonius Paulinus</i>,
a distinguished Roman general, entered Anglesey, and cut down the
groves, sacred to Druidic superstition, and placed a garrison
among the conquered.&nbsp; And in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 79, Titus Vespasian, the Roman
Emperor, sent <i>Julius Agricola</i>, a general not less renowned
for his military talents than for his wisdom and humanity; he
arrived in Mona, or Anglesey, and permanently secured the various
triumphs of the Romans.&nbsp; Thus the bloody rites of
superstition, the most powerful that ever enchained the human
mind, and after it had long established a boundless tyranny upon
the ruins of human reason, was abolished throughout the
island.</p>
<blockquote><p>Their sacred Isle with solemn woods were
crown&rsquo;d,<br />
Their woods are gone, dismantled lies the ground<br />
Of holy Druids, once the reverend shrine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is therefore, obvious, that these cromlechs were erected
long before the fatal slaughter by Suetonius; and it is nearly
1800 years since he gave a death-blow to the system.</p>
<p>This must be a deeply interesting spot to visit, at a time
when the summer&rsquo;s sun smiles on every object.&nbsp; As has
been observed it was <i>winter</i> when the writer visited the
cromlechs; but even then the prospect was grand.&nbsp; Standing
here you have a most commanding view in every direction,
comprising, sea and land, mountain and plain, lake and
river.&nbsp; The towering mountains of Carnarvonshire, like
another world, ethereal, brilliant, transparent as crystal,
appeared in the distance covered with snow, and presented a
resemblance to the Alps; far above the rest, Snowdon lifted its
patriarchal head so loftily, as if it meant not only to threaten,
but to thrust it into the sky.&nbsp; The sun, hastening towards
the western skies, threw his parting rays upon this Alpine range
of mountains, gilding them so magnificently, that the writer and
his accompanying friend were led to exclaim, &ldquo;Winter has
its beauties as well as summer.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>ANCIENT STONES OF MEMORIAL.</h3>
<p>Stones or pillars were the earliest records of all great or
highly interesting events.&nbsp; Covenants, important treaties or
victories, the deaths of distinguished persons, or dearly beloved
friends, the settled boundaries of estates, were all recorded in
this simple, but for the time, no doubt, sufficient manner.&nbsp;
The first historical notice bearing directly upon the subject is
the scriptural mention of a stone set up by Jacob to commemorate
his vision.&nbsp; (Gen. xxviii. 18.)&nbsp; The size of this stone
was necessarily small, like perhaps, those ancient stones
dispersed about our own country, three or four feet high, and
whose history lies too far back even for the reach of
tradition.&nbsp; We may also mention the stone set up by Joshua,
under the oak of Shechem, a little before his death, when he made
the Israelites once more solemnly renew their covenant with
God.&nbsp; (Josh. xxiv. 26.)&nbsp; In the First Book of Samuel,
chap. vi. 15, 18, a stone of great magnitude is referred to, and
which was previously well known as the great stone of Abel.&nbsp;
The solemn treaty of peace concluded between Jacob and Laban was
marked by the erection of a rude pillar.&nbsp; (Gen. xxxi.
45.)</p>
<p>The custom of setting up large stones to commemorate
victories, we find, from the sacred writings, was also in use
among the Hebrews.&nbsp; The Ebenezer, or &ldquo;stone of
help,&rdquo; set up by Samuel, is an instance of this
nature.&nbsp; (1 Sam. vii. 12.)&nbsp; In the British Isles the
custom appears to have been not only common, but to have
continued down to a late period.&nbsp; Thus we find Malcolm, son
of Kenneth, King of Scots, commemorating his victory over the
Danes in this mode in 1008.&nbsp; Near Newbridge, in the county
of Cork, Ireland, are three large stones set edgeways towards
each other, which are said, by an incontrovertible tradition, to
refer to a battle fought on the spot between Brian Boiruma, King
of Munster, and the O&rsquo;Mahonies of Carbery, assisted by the
Danes, most of whom were slain.</p>
<p>With regard to sepulchral stones, we may observe, that when
cases occurred with the Hebrews, that it became necessary to
inter distinguished persons at a distance from the resting-places
of their fathers, the rude pillar was then set up to mark the
place.&nbsp; It was under circumstances of this nature that Jacob
set up a stone over his beloved Rachel.&nbsp; (Gen. xxxv.
20.)&mdash;Among some of the nations of antiquity, the custom was
<a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>very
general; the Greeks, for instance, had for ages no other funeral
monuments than a rough unhewn stone, set upon the top of a
tumulus.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; we find Paris, whilst
in the act of using the bow against the enemy, bending behind the
pillar placed on the tumulus that contained the ashes of Ilus,
the son of Dardanus, the ancient king of Troy.&nbsp; Minutely
corresponding with this monument is the one at Castle More, near
Tullagh, Ireland.&nbsp; It consists of a tumulus 30 feet in
perpendicular height, with a square stone on the top, about 5
feet in height.&nbsp; We have one positive and interesting case
on record of the erection of a vast monument of this kind.&nbsp;
Harold, the son of Gormon, employed his whole army to draw a
stone of enormous size from the shores of Jutland, to be placed
over the grave of his mother.&nbsp; We may observe that our own
churchyards, to this day, present but a modification of the
usages we have described&mdash;in the mound and headstone we
still see the tumulus and pillar of ancient times.&nbsp; To this
origin, doubtless, may be referred many, if not all, of the large
stones isolated from Druidical remains, and dispersed in
different parts of the county.</p>
<p>The <i>maen hir</i>, or long stone, is very common in this
Island.&nbsp; There is nothing, however, in its name which would
indicate its original use, or the object for which it was raised,
unless, indeed, we give the word <i>hir</i>, the sense of longing
or regret, as being the root of <i>hiraeth</i>; in that case it
might imply that the stone was a memorial of the dead.&nbsp;
There is no doubt that, in some instances, it was used as a
monument to point out the grave of a particular person.</p>
<p>Thus an extract from an old document is inserted by Mr. Price
in his &ldquo;Hanes Cymru,&rdquo; (History of Wales) to the
following effect:&mdash;&ldquo;The <i>Meini Hirion</i> (long
stones) of <i>Maes Mawr</i> (of the Great Plain.)&nbsp; There is
a spot on the mountain between Yale and Ystrad Alun, above
Rhyd-y-Gyfartha, called the Great Plain, where occurred the
battle between Meilyr ab &mdash; and Beli ab Benlli Gawr, and
where Beli was slain; and Meirion erected two stones, one at each
end of the grave, which remained until the last forty
years.&nbsp; It was then that a &ldquo;tasteless&rdquo; person,
owner of the piece of land, which had been enclosed, where the
grave and stones were, came and pulled up the stones, and placed
them over the pipe of a lime-kiln.&nbsp; There, in consequence of
the intense heat and great weight, they broke.&nbsp; Whereupon he
burnt them into lime in the kiln, though they had been there for
many hundred years; and a bad end happened unto him who had thus
<a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>defaced
the grave of the deceased soldier, about which the bard, in the
&ldquo;Stanzas of the Graves,&rdquo; sang this
triplet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Whose is the grave in the Great Plain?<br />
Proud was his hand on the weapon of war&mdash;<br />
It is the grave of Beli the son of Benlli Gawr!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several of these monumental stones in the immediate
neighbourhood of Holyhead, and though their history is unknown, I
have not a doubt on my mind but they were originally erected as
<i>memorial stones</i>, to point out the grave of some
distinguished person or persons, or as monuments to commemorate
some signal victory.</p>
<p>About a mile from Holyhead, on the way to Trefigneth
cromlechi, on the right hand, in a field called <i>Cae&rsquo;r
Garreg</i> (stone field), stands a memorial stone, 8 feet long,
and 10 feet in circumference at the base, tapering to about 5
feet.&nbsp; On leaving this stone, and just before you reach
Trefigneth, opposite a cow-shed, under the left-hand wall, a
<i>cist faen</i>, or stone coffin, was found some time ago,
containing a human skeleton.&nbsp; About half a mile further,
near <i>Trefarthur</i> (the abode of Arthur), in a field on the
right hand, called <i>Caynyodd</i>, are two stones, one erect,
about 5 feet in length, and 13 in circumference, and the other,
reposing on the ground, nearly 8 feet long.</p>
<p>About a mile and a half to the west of Holyhead, at
<i>Plas</i> farm, in the occupation of O. Owen, Esq., are two
large stones.&nbsp; The western one is 10 feet long, 6&frac12;
feet in circumference, tapering to about 4 feet.&nbsp; The
northern stone is 10 feet long, 6&frac12; feet in circumference,
tapering to about 5 feet.</p>
<h3>BOUNDARY STONES.</h3>
<p>The use of stones erect, for marking boundaries, must be very
ancient; perhaps, indeed, this was one of the earliest purposes
to which such rude monuments were applied.&nbsp; An interesting
notice of this custom is given in the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; where
Homer, speaking of the great stone thrown by Minerva at Mars,
says, as King renders the passage, that &ldquo;she retreating,
seized in her strong hand a stone lying in the field&mdash;black,
rough, and vast&mdash;which men in former times had placed as a
boundary of cultivated land.&rdquo;&nbsp; How long and how
effectually this custom existed, Olaus Magnaus, archbishop of
Upsal and metropolitan of Sweden, speaking of his own parts,
about the middle of the seventeenth <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>century, bears testimony with
justifiable pride:&mdash;&ldquo;There are also high stones, by
the aspect and signature whereof the ancient possessions of
provinces, governments, forts, communities of noble and country
men, are suffered to continue to every man in peace, without
laws, suits, or arbitration, giving an example to other nations,
that among these nations there is more right to be found in these
stones that are boundaries than elsewhere in the large volumes of
laws, where men think themselves to be more learned and
civil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stringent laws were given by Moses to the Jewish nation in
reference to these boundary marks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou shalt not
remove thy neighbour&rsquo;s landmark, which they of old time
have set in thine inheritance.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Deut. xix.
14.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Remove not the ancient landmark which thy
fathers have set.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Prov. xxii. 28.)&nbsp; Job
complained that some in his day removed the landmarks (chap,
xxiv. ver. 2).&nbsp; Every one will remember the fearful
denunciation in the book of Deuteronomy,&mdash;&ldquo;Cursed be
he that removeth his neighbour&rsquo;s landmark.&nbsp; And all
the people shall say, Amen,&rdquo; (chap, xxvii. ver. 17).&nbsp;
In Hosea we have the following strong language, which shews in
what light Jehovah viewed this sin:&mdash;&ldquo;The princes of
Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore will I pour
out my wrath upon them like water,&rdquo; (chap. v. ver. 10).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<i>maen terfyn</i>,&rdquo; i.e., the boundary stone
of the Ancient Britons, is considered to be very common in this
Island, the removal of which was punishable with death.&nbsp;
<i>Maen terfyn</i> was not to be removed, according to the laws
of Dyvnwal Moelmud, under pain of death:&mdash;&ldquo;There are
three stones, which if any man remove, he shall be indicted as a
thief: the <i>boundary stone</i>; <i>maen gwyn</i> (sacred
stone), of the convention, and the guide stone; and he that
destroys them shall forfeit his life (or be guilty of capital
offence).&rdquo;&nbsp; In reference to this stone another triad
remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;It is ordered and established, for the
purpose of preventing the uncertainty of a claim, that the Bards
shall keep an orderly record of pedigrees, nobility, and
inheritances.&nbsp; For the same purpose also is the memorial of
the back-fire stones, the <i>maen terfyn</i> (boundary stone),
and the horse-block, that he that removes them offers an insult
to the Court and the Judges.&rdquo;&nbsp; These passages will
forcibly remind our readers of the penalty in the law of Moses
above quoted.&nbsp; Whenever we hear of ancestral domains
terminating here and there at some particular stones of
notoriety, as is frequently the case, we may fairly presume <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>that such
stones are some of the old <i>meini terfyn</i> (boundary stones)
of the Welsh laws.</p>
<p>On the right hand of the road, in a corner of the field before
you reach Plas farm, is a stone measuring 4 feet high, by 5 wide,
and about 12 feet in circumference.&nbsp; I consider this stone a
perfect relic of what our ancestors denominated <i>maen
terfyn</i>, or the boundary stone.</p>
<p>And now, courteous reader, farewell! may you enjoy your visit
to this interesting locality: but it is high time that the writer
of these pages fixed his boundary mark.&mdash;<span

<p>To Professor Holloway,</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I have much pleasure in handing to you a
testimonial of the efficiency of your Medicines.&nbsp; A person
in this neighbourhood with whom I am well acquainted was
afflicted for a long time with violent spasmodic pains in the
stomach and liver, arising from frequent colds, smells of paint,
and the effects of a stooping position which he was obliged to
assume in his business.&nbsp; The spasms were of an alarming
character, and frequently left him in a weak and debilitated
condition.&nbsp; At length he heard of the salutary effects of
your invaluable Pills, and was induced to give them a
trial.&nbsp; The first dose gave him considerable relief, and by
following them up in accordance with your directions, they have
acted so wonderfully in cleansing the liver and stomach, and
strengthening the digestive organs that he has been restored to
the enjoyment of good health.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">January 12th, 1853.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I feel great
pleasure in making a public acknowledgment of the good I have
received from your valuable medicines.&nbsp; I have been
afflicted from childhood with severe attacks of bilious
complaint, every five or six weeks; I have suffered dreadfully
from spasms, scarce ever free from them little or much: I have
suffered from bad legs for these last twenty years.&nbsp; I have
dreaded the approach of winter, for they would be then covered
with scaly bleeding running sores from the knees to the ankles: I
have been afflicted for these last ten years with rheumatism with
repeated attacks of lumbago; I have been troubled from a child
with great quantities of worms, and for these last five years I
have suffered from a fistula, which gradually increasing, caused
great pain and lowness of spirits, so I continued up to September
1851; when my afflictions increased&mdash;I was seized with
severe griping pains in the bowels, for which by taking large
doses of medicines and drugs, would relieve me for a few days,
then they would return more violent.&nbsp; Worms made their way
through the wound of the fistula in abundance.&nbsp; Four months
I endured dreadful pains in the chest.&nbsp; I felt as if I were
bound round with an iron bar.&nbsp; I felt dreadful pains across
the back and shoulders, my neck became stiff, my eyes bloodshot;
there appeared a heavy weight on my head, with a hissing noise
like a steam engine, my arms seemed filled with streams of
boiling water; I had every advice within my reach.&nbsp; I had
blisters and mustard plasters to my chest in abundance; I had
Doctors and medicines of every description, but all to no use, I
gave myself up for lost; the last doctor told me my liver was
dreadfully affected, and if I did not take care, I would have the
yellow jaundice, and that the wound proceeded from the liver; he
did me no good, there was no hope but the hospital, but I dreaded
the knife.&nbsp; A friend at last persuaded me to try <span
class="smcap">Morison&rsquo;s Pills</span>, but I was so
prejudiced against them, I ridiculed the very idea, but try them
I did, glad to catch at any thing, and thank God I did; they made
me very bad at first, but I persevered, beginning with five of
No. 2, increasing one each night up to nine.&nbsp; I found
relief, they stopped the violence of the fistula, they relieved
the pains in my chest, and brought from me frightful quantities
of worms.&nbsp; I then bought some No. 1&rsquo;s of Mr. Lofts,
No. 1, Park-place, Mile End-road, and took them alternately,
increasing the doses up to 12, and they were the cause of my
passing five pieces of thick skinny substance, the size of the
palms of the hand.&nbsp; I commenced taking the pills January
1852.&nbsp; In May the lumbago attacked me violently, in June my
legs broke out worse; I increased the doses 16 each night, they
soon got well, but there was a pain under the ribs of the right
side&mdash;something appeared to be gathering there, it got
bigger and heavier, till it appeared to be as big as a pint
bason.&nbsp; I decreased the doses to 18, it got worse; I
increased the noses to 20, my whole back seemed inflamed, in
three hours after, I took 10 more, something gave a sudden snap,
I was sick for the first time since the commencement, upwards and
downwards came from me several pints of slime, blood, and
corruption, &amp;c.&mdash;<a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>the pills had done their work, and I
was healed; since that time I have had a few flying pains.&nbsp;
I have gradually decreased the doses down to the present
time.&nbsp; I am restored to health and strength.&nbsp; I feel 10
years younger, and I thank the Almighty God in putting within my
reach your most valuable medicines; since I began to take your
pills, I have been exposed to all weathers, working in a market
garden, and I have been laid up for illness but one day through
the whole time.</p>

coincidence that the very night, and about the same hour, these

feelings.&nbsp; How many brave crews leave their respective
ports, never to return!&nbsp; And, alas! how many of these,

back upon us, from the shores of that untried world, upbraiding

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
